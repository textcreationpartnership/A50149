            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Station in which the Hand of the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath diſpoſed His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Heart to place your Honour, doth ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly entitle your Lordſhip to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Narrative, that its being thus Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Excellencies Hand is thereby both Apologized for and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. I believe, had the Writer of it, when he Penned it, had any Knowledge of your Excellency, he would himſelf have done it, and withal would have amply and publickly Congratulated the
<pb facs="tcp:50205:3"/>People of <hi>New England,</hi> on account of their having ſuch a Governour, and your Excellency on account of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Governour over them. For though as to ſome other things it may poſſibly be a place to ſome Perſons not ſo deſirable, yet I believe this Character may be juſtly given of them, that they are the beſt People under Heaven; there being among them, not only leſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Profaneneſs, and leſs of Lewdneſs, but alſo more of the ſerious Profeſſion, Practiſe, and Power of Chriſtianity in proportion to their number, then is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong any other People upon the Face of the whole Earth. Not but I doubt, there are many bad Perſons among them, and too many diſtemper'd Humours, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps even among thoſe who are truly good. It would be a wonder, if it ſhould be otherwiſe; for it hath of late Years on various accounts, and ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſingular and unuſual ones, been a Day of ſore Temptation with that whole People. Nevertheleſs, as I look upon it as a Favour from God to thoſe Plantations
<pb facs="tcp:50205:3"/>that he hath ſet your Excellency over them, ſo I do account it a Favour from God to your Excellency, that he hath committed and truſted in your Hand, ſo great a part of his peculiar Treaſure and precious Jewels, as are among that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Beſides, that on other accounts the Lord Jeſus hath more of a viſible Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in <hi>New England,</hi> then in any of the outgoings of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> They have at their own Charge not only ſet up Schools of lower Learning up and down the Country; but have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo erected an Univerſity, which hath been the happy Nurſery of many uſeful, Learned, and excellently accompliſhed Perſons. And moreover, from them hath the bleſſed Goſpel been Preached to the poor barbarous ſavage <hi>Heathen</hi> there, and it hath taken ſuch root among them, that there were lately four and twenty Aſſemblies in which the Name of the Lord Jeſus was conſtantly called on, and celebrated in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. In theſe things <hi>New England</hi> outſhineth all the Colonies of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50205:4"/>in thoſe goings down of the Sun. I know your Excellency will Favour and Countenance their Univerſity, and alſo the Propagating of the Goſpel among the Natives; for the Intereſt of Chriſt in that Part of the Earth is much concerned in them. That the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh would abundantly repleniſh your Excellency with a ſuitable Spirit for the Service to which he hath called your Lordſhip, that he would give your Honour a proſperous Voyage thither, and when there, make your Excellency a rich Bleſſing to that People, and them a rejoycing to your Excellency, is the Prayer of</p>

               <p>HIS Friends earneſtly ſolicited him to ſettle among them in a Plantation of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> but he had an Unaccountable <hi>Impulſe</hi> upon his Mind, perſwading him, as he would privately hint unto ſome of them, <hi>That he was Born to Greater Matters.</hi> To come at thoſe <hi>Greater Matters,</hi> his firſt Contrivance was to bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Apprentice unto a <hi>Ship-Carpenter</hi> for Four Years; in which Time, he became a Maſter of the <hi>Trade,</hi> that once in a Veſſel of more than <hi>Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Tuns,</hi> Repaired the Ruines of the Earth.

At <hi>Boſton,</hi> where it was that he now learnt, firſt of all, to <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Write;</hi> be followed his Trade for about a Year; and, by a laudable Deportment, ſo recommended himſelf, that he Married a Young Gentlewoman of Good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, who was the Widow of one Mr. <hi>John Hull,</hi> a well-bred Merchant, but the Daughter of one Captain <hi>Roger Spencer,</hi> a Perſon of good Faſhion, who having ſuffer'd much dammage in his Eſtate, by ſome unkind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt actions, which he bore with ſuch Patience, that for fear of thereby injuring the Publick, he would not ſeek ſatisfaction, <hi>Poſterity</hi> might afterwards ſee the reward of his <hi>patience,</hi> in what Providence hath now done for one of his own <hi>Poſterity.</hi> Within a little while after his Marriage, he Indented with ſeveral
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50205:10"/>perſons in <hi>Boſton,</hi> to build them a Ship at <hi>Sheeps-coat</hi> River, two or three Leagues Eaſtward of <hi>Kennebeck;</hi> where having Lanched the Ship, he alſo provided a <hi>Lading</hi> of Lumber to bring with him, which would have been to the advantage of all concern'd. But juſt as the Ship was hardly finiſhed, the barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> on that River, broke forth into an Open and Cruel War upon the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the miſerable People, ſurpriſed by ſo ſudden a ſtorm of Bloud, had no Refuge from the Infidels, but the <hi>Ship</hi> now finiſhing in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

               <p>BUT he was hitherto, no more than beginning to make <hi>Scaffolds</hi> for further and higher <hi>Actions!</hi> He would frequently tell the Gentlewoman his Wife, That he ſhould yet be <hi>Captain of a King's Ship;</hi> That he ſhould come to have the <hi>Command of better Men</hi> than he was now accounted himſelf; And, That he ſhould be Owner of a <hi>Fair Brick-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Green-Lane</hi> of <hi>North-Boſton;</hi> and, That it may be, this would not be all that the Providence of God would bring him to.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50205:11"/>reciting one Inſtance of his Conduct, that ſhow'd him to be a Perſon of no contemptible Capacity. While he was Captain of the <hi>Algier-Roſe,</hi> his Men growing weary of their unſucceſsful Enterprize, made a Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wherein they approach'd him on the Quarter-Deck, with Drawn Swords in their Hands, and required him to join with them in Running away with the Ship, to drive a Trade of Pyracy on the <hi>South Seas.</hi> Captain <hi>Phips,</hi> though he had not ſo much of a Weapon, as an <hi>Ox-Goad,</hi> or a <hi>Jaw-bone</hi> in his Hands, yet like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Shamgar</hi> or <hi>Sampſon,</hi> with a moſt undaunted For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he ruſh'd in upon them, and with the Blows of his bare Hands, <hi>Fell'd</hi> many of them, and <hi>Quell'd</hi> all the Reſt. But this is not the Inſtance which I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That which I intend is, That (as it has been related unto me) One Day, while his Frigate lay <hi>Careening,</hi> at a deſolate <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Iſland, by the ſide of a Rock, from whence they had laid a Bridge to the Shoar, the Men, whereof he had about an <hi>Hundred,</hi> went all but about Eight or Ten, to divert themſelves, as they pretended, in the <hi>Woods:</hi> Where, they all entred into an <hi>Agreement,</hi> which they Sign'd in a Ring, That about ſeven a Clock that Evening, they would ſeize the Captain, and thoſe Eight or Ten, which they knew to be True unto him, and leave them to periſh on this Iſland, and ſo be gone away unto the <hi>South Sea</hi> to <hi>ſeek their Fortune.</hi> Will the Reader now imagine, that Captain <hi>Phips</hi> having Advice of this Plot, but about an Hour and half before it was to be put in Execution, yet within <hi>Two Hours</hi> brought all theſe Rogues down upon their Knees, to beg for their lives? But ſo it was! For theſe Knaves conſidering, that they ſhould want a <hi>Carpenter</hi> with them in their <hi>Villanous Expedition,</hi> ſent a Meſſenger to fetch unto them the <hi>Carpenter,</hi> who was then at Work upon the Veſſel; and unto him they ſhew'd their <hi>Articles,</hi> telling him what he muſt look for, if he did not <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> among them. The <hi>Carpenter</hi> being an honeſt Fellow, did with much importunity, prevail for one half hours Time to conſider of the Matter; and returning to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50205:11"/>Work upon the Veſſel, with a <hi>Spy</hi> by them ſet upon him, he feigned himſelf taken with a Fit of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> for the Relief whereof he ſuddenly run unto the Captain in the Great Cabbin for a <hi>Dram;</hi> where, when he came, his buſineſs was only in brief, to tell the Captain of the horrible Diſtreſs which he was fallen into; but the Captain bid him as briefly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Rogues in the <hi>Woods,</hi> and Sign their <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and leave <hi>him</hi> to provide for the Reſt. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter</hi> was no ſooner gone, but Captain <hi>Phips</hi> calling together the few Friends (it may be ſeven or eight) that were left him aboard, whereof the Gunner was one, demanded of them, whether they would ſtand by him in the Extremity, which he informed them was now come upon him; whereto they reply'd, <hi>They would ſtand by him, if he could ſave them;</hi> And he Anſwer'd, <hi>By the help of God, he did not fear it.</hi> All their Proviſions had been carried a ſhoar to a Tent, made for that purpoſe there; about which they had placed ſeveral Great Guns to defend it, in caſe of any <hi>Aſſault</hi> from <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that might happen to come that way. Wherefore Captain <hi>Phips,</hi> immediately ordered thoſe Guns to be ſilently Drawn and Turn'd; and ſo, pulling up the Bridge, he charged his Great Guns aboard, and brought them to Bear on every ſide of the Tent. By this Time the <hi>Army of Rebels</hi> comes out of the Woods; but as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50205:12"/>them, they fell to very humble Entreaties; and at laſt, fell down upon their Knees, proteſting, <hi>That they never had any thing againſt him, except only his unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs to go away with the King's Ship upon the</hi> South-Sea <hi>Deſign: But upon all other Accounts, they would chooſe rather to Live and Die with him, than with any Man in the World; however, ſince they ſaw how much he was diſſatisfied at it, they would inſiſt upon it no more, and humbly begg'd his Pardon.</hi> And when he judg'd, that he had kept them on their <hi>Knees</hi> long enough, he having firſt ſecur'd their <hi>Arms,</hi> received them aboard; but he immediately weighed Anchor, and arriving at <hi>Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> he Turn'd them off.

This <hi>Periaga,</hi> with the <hi>Tender,</hi> being Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at a place convenient, the <hi>Periaga</hi> kept Buſking to and again, but could only diſcover a <hi>Reef of Riſing Shoals</hi> thereabouts, called <hi>The Boilers,</hi> which Riſing to be within Two or Three Foot of the Surface of the Sea, were yet ſo ſteep, that a Ship ſtriking on them, would immediately ſink down, who could ſay, <hi>how many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom?</hi> into the Ocean.

Nevertheleſs, as they were upon the Return, one of the Men looking over the ſide of the <hi>Periaga,</hi> into the calm Water, he ſpied a <hi>Sea Feather,</hi> growing as he judged, out of a Rock; whereupon they bad one of their <hi>Indians</hi> to Dive, and fetch this <hi>Feather,</hi> that they might however carry home <hi>ſomething</hi> with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50205:13"/>them, and make, at leaſt, as fair a Trinmph as <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>'s. The <hi>Diver,</hi> bringing up the <hi>Feather,</hi> brought therewithal a ſurprizing ſtory, That he perceived a Number of <hi>Great Guns</hi> in the <hi>Watry World</hi> where he had found his <hi>Feather;</hi> the <hi>Report</hi> of which <hi>Great Guns</hi> exceedingly aſtoniſhed the whole Company; and at once, turned their <hi>Deſpondencies</hi> for their ill ſucceſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſſurances,</hi> that they had now lit upon the <hi>True ſpot</hi> of Ground which they had been looking for; and they were further confirmed in theſe <hi>Aſſurances,</hi> when upon further Diving, the <hi>Indian</hi> fetcht up a <hi>Sow,</hi> as they ſtil'd it, or a Lump of Silver, worth perhaps, Two or Three Hundred Pounds. Upon this they prudently <hi>Buoy'd</hi> the place, that they might readily find it again; And they went back unto their Captain, whom for ſome while, they diſtreſſed with nothing but ſuch <hi>Bad News,</hi> as they formerly thought they muſt have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: Nevertheleſs they ſo ſlipt in the Sow of Silver, on one ſide under the Table, where they were now ſitting with the Captain, and hearing him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Reſolutions to wait ſtill patiently upon the Providence of God under theſe Diſappointments, that when he ſhould look on one ſide, he might ſee that <hi>Odd Thing</hi> before him. At laſt he <hi>ſaw</hi> it; ſeeing it, he cryed out with ſome Agony, <hi>Why? What is this? Whence comes this?</hi> And then, with changed Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they told him <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> they got it: <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Thanks be to God! We are made;</hi> And ſo, away they went, all hands to Work; wherein they had this one further piece of Remarkable Proſperity, that whereas, if they had firſt fallen upon that part of the <hi>Spaniſh Wreck,</hi> where the Pieces of Eight had been ſtowed in Bags among the Ballaſt, they had ſeen a more laborious, and leſs enriching time of it: Now, moſt happily, they firſt fell upon that Room in the <hi>Wreck,</hi> where the <hi>Bullion</hi> had been ſtored up; and they ſo proſpered in this <hi>New Fiſhery,</hi> that in a little while they had, without the loſs of any Man's Life, brought up <hi>Thirty Two Tuns</hi> of Silver; for it was now come to meaſuring of Silver by <hi>Tuns.</hi> Beſides which, one <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50205:13"/>of <hi>Providence,</hi> who had formerly been very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Captain <hi>Phips</hi> in the Search of this <hi>Wreck,</hi> did upon former Agreement meet him now, with a little Veſſel here; and <hi>he,</hi> with his few hands, took up about <hi>Six Tuns</hi> of Silver; whereof nevertheleſs, he made ſo little uſe, that in a year or two, he died at <hi>Bermudas,</hi> and as I have heard, he ran <hi>Diſtracled</hi> ſome while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died. Thus did there once again, come into the Light of the Sun, a Treaſure which had been half an Hundred Years <hi>groaning under the Waters:</hi> And in this time, there was grown upon the Plate, a Cruſt like <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>imeſtone,</hi> to the thickneſs of ſeveral Inches; which Cruſt being broken open, by Irons contrived for that purpoſe, they knockt out whole Buſhels of ruſty Pieces of Eight, which were grown thereinto. Beſides that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Treaſure of Plate in various forms, thus fetch'd up, from ſeven or eight Fathom under Water, there were vaſt Riches of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>Jewels,</hi> which they alſo lit upon; and indeed, for a more Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive <hi>Invoice,</hi> I muſt but ſummarily ſay, <hi>All that a</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Frigate uſes to be enricht withal.</hi> Thus did they continue <hi>Fiſhing</hi> till their Proviſions failing them, 'twas time to be gone; but before they went, Captain <hi>Phips</hi> cauſed <hi>Adderly</hi> and his Folk to ſwear, That they would none of them Diſcover the place of the <hi>Wreck,</hi> or come to the Place any more till the next Year, when he expected again to be there himſelf. And it was alſo Remarkable, that though the Sows came up ſtill ſo faſt, that on the very laſt Day of their being there, they took up <hi>Twenty,</hi> yet it was afterwards found, that they had in a manner wholly cleared that Room of the Ship, where thoſe <hi>Maſſy things</hi> were Stowed.</p>
               <p>But there was one extraordinary Diſtreſs which Captain <hi>Phips</hi> now found himſelf plunged into: For his Men were come out with him upon Seamens Wages, at ſo much <hi>per</hi> Month; and when they ſaw ſuch vaſt Litters of Silver <hi>Sows</hi> and <hi>Pigs,</hi> as they call them, come on Board them, at the Captains Call, they knew not how to bear it, that they ſhould not <hi>ſhare</hi> all among themſelves, and be gone to lead <hi>a ſhort life and a merry,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50205:14"/>in a Climate, where the Arreſt of thoſe that had hired them, ſhould not reach them. In this terrible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, he made his Vows unto Almighty God, that if the Lord would carry him ſafe home to <hi>England,</hi> with what <hi>he</hi> had now given him, <hi>to ſuck of the abundance of the Seas, and of the Treaſures hid in the Sands,</hi> he would for ever Devote himſelf unto the Intereſts of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of his People, eſpecially in the <hi>Country</hi> which he did himſelf Originally belong unto. And he then uſed all the obliging <hi>Arts</hi> imaginable, to make his Men true unto him, eſpecially by aſſuring them, that beſides their <hi>Wages,</hi> they ſhould have ample <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitals</hi> made unto them; which if the reſt of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers would not agree unto, he would himſelf diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his <hi>own ſhare</hi> among them. Relying upon the Word of One, whom they had ever found worthy of their <hi>Love,</hi> and of their <hi>Truſt,</hi> they declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Content:</hi> But ſtill keeping a moſt careful Eye upon them, he haſtned back for <hi>England,</hi> with as much <hi>Money</hi> as he thought he could then ſafely <hi>Truſt</hi> his Veſſel withal; not counting it ſafe to ſupply himſelf with neceſſary Proviſions at any nearer Port, and ſo return unto the <hi>Wreck,</hi> by which delays, he wiſely feared leſt all might be loſt, more ways than one. Though he alſo left ſo much behind him, that many from divers parts made very conſiderable Voyages of <hi>Gleanings</hi> after his <hi>Harveſt:</hi> which came to paſs by certain <hi>Bermudians,</hi> compelling of <hi>Adderly</hi>'s Boy, whom they <hi>ſpirited</hi> away with them, to tell them the exact place where the <hi>Wreck</hi> was to be found. Captain <hi>Phips</hi> now coming up to <hi>London,</hi> in the Year 1687. with near <hi>Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds ſterling</hi> aboard him, did acquit himſelf with ſuch an Exemplary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, that partly by his fulfilling his Aſſurances to the Scamen, and partly by his exact and punctual Care to have his Employers defrauded of nothing that might conſcientiouſly belong unto them, he had leſs than <hi>ſixteen Thouſand pounds</hi> left unto himſelf: As an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of which <hi>Honeſty</hi> in him, the Duke of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marl</hi> made unto his Wife, whom he never ſaw, a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50205:14"/>of a <hi>Golden Cup,</hi> near a Thouſand Pound in value. The Character of an <hi>Honeſt Man,</hi> he had ſo merited in the whole Courſe of his Life, and eſpecially in this laſt act of it, that this, in conjunction with his other ſerviceable Qualities, procured him the Favours of the Greateſt Perſons in the Nation; And <hi>He that had been ſo diligent in his Buſineſs, muſt now ſtand before Kings, and not ſtand before mean Men,</hi> There were indeed, certain <hi>mean Men,</hi> if baſe, little, dirty Tricks will enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Men to Meanneſs, who urged the King, to ſeize his <hi>whole Cargoe,</hi> inſtead of the Tenths, upon his firſt Arrival; on this pretence, that he had not been right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform'd of the <hi>True ſtate of the Caſe,</hi> when he Granted the <hi>Patent,</hi> under the Protection whereof theſe <hi>particular Men</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of all this Mighty Treaſure; but the King replied, That he had been <hi>rightly informed</hi> by Captain <hi>Phips</hi> of the whole matter, as it now proved, and that it was the ſlanders of one then preſent, which had, unto his Dammage, hindred him from hearkning to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: Wherefore he would give them, he ſaid, no Diſturbance, they might keep what they had got; but Captain <hi>Phips,</hi> he ſaw, was a Perſon of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, Fidelity and Ability, that he ſhould not want his Countenance. Accordingly the King, in conſideration of the Service done by him, in bringing ſuch a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into the Nation, conferr'd upon him the Honour of <hi>Knighthood;</hi> And if we now reckon him, <hi>A Knight of the Golden Fleece,</hi> the Stile might pretend unto ſome circumſtances that would juſtifie it. Or call him, if you pleaſe, <hi>The Knight of Honeſty;</hi> for it was <hi>Honeſty</hi> with <hi>Induſtry,</hi> that Raiſed him; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Mighty River, without the running in of Muddy Water to make him ſo.

               <p>IT Would require a long Summers-Day to Relate the miſeries which were come, and coming in upon poor <hi>New-England,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> then Impoſed on them; A <hi>Government</hi> wherein, as Old <hi>Wendover</hi> ſays of the Time, when <hi>Strangers</hi> were domineering over <hi>Subjects</hi> in <hi>England, Judicia committebantur Injuſtis, Leges Exlegibus, Pax Diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantibus, Juſtitia Injurioſis;</hi> and <hi>Foxes</hi> were made the Adminiſtrators of Juſtice to the <hi>Poultrey;</hi> yet ſome <hi>Abridgement</hi> of them is neceſſary for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Matters yet before us. Now, to make this <hi>Abridgment</hi> Impartial, I ſhall only have Recourſe unto a Little Book, Printed at <hi>London,</hi> under the Title of <hi>The Revolution</hi> of New-England <hi>Juſtiſied;</hi> wherein we have a <hi>Narrative of the Grievances</hi> under the Male Adminiſtrations of that Government, written and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the chief Gentlemen of the <hi>Governour's Council;</hi> together with the <hi>Sworn Teſtimonies</hi> of many Good men, to prove the Several Articles of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> which the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> publiſhed againſt their Oppreſſors. It is in that Book demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That,</hi> the Governour neglecting the Greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his <hi>Council,</hi> did Adhere principally to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a <hi>few Strangers,</hi> who were perſons without any <hi>Intereſt,</hi> in the Country, but of Declared <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt it, and had plainly laid their <hi>Deſigns</hi> to make an Unreaſonable <hi>Profit</hi> of the poor people: and <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> perſons had the Abſolute Rule <hi>over a Territory, the moſt Conſiderable of any belorging to the Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> when <hi>Laws</hi> were propoſed in the <hi>Council,</hi> tho the <hi>major</hi> part at any time Diſſented from them, yet, if the Governour were poſitive, there was no fair <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> the Number of <hi>Councellors</hi> Conſenting, or Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but the Laws were immediatly <hi>Engroſſed, publiſhed</hi> and <hi>Executed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50205:17"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That,</hi> This <hi>Junto</hi> made a <hi>Law,</hi> which prohibited the Inhabitants of any <hi>Town,</hi> to meet about their <hi>Town-Affairs,</hi> above <hi>once</hi> in a year; for fear, you muſt Note, of their having any opportunity to Complain of <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> they made another <hi>Law,</hi> requiring all Maſters of <hi>Veſſels,</hi> even <hi>Shallops,</hi> and <hi>Wood-boats</hi> to give <hi>Security,</hi> that no Man ſhould be Tranſported in them, except his name had been ſo many Days poſted up: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Pockets of a few <hi>Leeches</hi> had been filled with <hi>Fees,</hi> but the whole Trade of the Country deſtroyed; and all Attempts to obtain a <hi>Redreſs</hi> of theſe Things obſtructed; And when this <hi>Act</hi> had been ſtrenuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Council at <hi>Boſton,</hi> they carried it as far as <hi>New-York,</hi> where a Crew of them enacted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That,</hi> without any <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> they Levied on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a <hi>penny</hi> in the pound of all their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and Twenty-pence <hi>per</hi> Head, as <hi>Poll-money,</hi> with a penny in the Pound for <hi>Goods</hi> Imported, beſides a Vaſt <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiſe</hi> on Wine, Rum and other <hi>Liquors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That,</hi> when among the Inhabitants of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> ſome of the Principal Perſons modeſtly gave Reaſons, why they could not chooſe a <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> to <hi>Tax</hi> the Town, until the King ſhould firſt be Petitioned for the Liberty of an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> they were committed unto <hi>Gaol</hi> for it, as an <hi>High Miſdemeanour,</hi> and were denied an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and were drag'd many Miles out of their own County to anſwer it at a Court in <hi>Boſton;</hi> where <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> were pickt for the Turn, that were not <hi>Freeholders,</hi> nay, that were meer <hi>ſojourners;</hi> and when the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners pleaded the Priviledges of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, <hi>That they ſhould not be Taxed without their own conſent,</hi> they were told, <hi>That thoſe things would not follow them to the ends of the earth:</hi> As it had been before told them in <hi>open Council,</hi> no one in the Council contradicting it, <hi>You have no more Priviledges left you, but this, that you are not bought and ſold for Slaves:</hi> And in fine, they were all <hi>fined</hi> ſeverely, and laid under great <hi>Bonds</hi> for their Good Behaviour; beſides all which, the <hi>hurgry Officers</hi> extorted <hi>Fees</hi> from them that amounted unto an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50205:17"/>and Threeſcore Pounds, whereas in <hi>England,</hi> upon the like Proſecution, the <hi>Fees</hi> would not have been Ten Pounds in all. After which faſhion the <hi>Townſmen</hi> of many other Places were alſo ſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Theſe Men giving out, That the <hi>Charters</hi> being loſt, all the Title that the People had unto their Lands, was loſt with them; they began to <hi>compel</hi> the People every where, to take <hi>Patents</hi> for their Lands: And accordingly <hi>Writs of Intruſion</hi> were iſſued out againſt the chief Gentlemen in the Territory, by the Terror whereof, many were actually driven to Petition for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> that they might quietly enjoy the Lands that had been fifty or ſixty Years in their poſſeſſion, But for theſe <hi>Patents,</hi> there were ſuch exorbitant Prices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that Fifty Pounds could not purchaſe for its Owner, an Eſtate not worth <hi>Two Hundred,</hi> nor could all the Money and Moveables in the Territory have defrayed the Charges of <hi>Patenting</hi> the Lands, at the Hands of theſe <hi>Crocodiles:</hi> beſides the conſiderable <hi>Quit-Rents</hi> for the King. Yea, the Governour cauſed the Lands of <hi>particular perſons</hi> to be meaſured out, and given to his Creatures: And ſome of his Council Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for the <hi>Commons</hi> belonging to ſeveral Towns; and the <hi>Agents</hi> of the Towns, going to get a <hi>voluntary Subſcription</hi> of the Inhabitants to maintain their Title at Law, they have been dragg'd Forty or Fifty Miles, to anſwer as Criminals at the next Aſſizes; the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in the mean time, extorting three Pounds <hi>per</hi> Man, for fetching them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That,</hi> if theſe <hi>Harpies,</hi> at any Time, were a little <hi>out of Money,</hi> they found ways to Impriſon the <hi>beſt men</hi> in the Countrey; and there appeared not the leaſt <hi>Information</hi> of any Crime exhibited againſt them, yet they were put unto Intollerable Expences by theſe Greedy Oppreſſors, and the Benefit of an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> not allowed unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> pack't and pick't <hi>Juries</hi> were Commonly made uſe of, when under a Pretended <hi>Form of Law,</hi> the Trouble of ſome Honeſt and Worthy Men, was aimed at; and theſe alſo were hurried out of their own
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50205:18"/>Counties to be tried, when <hi>Juries</hi> for the Turn, were not like to be found there. The <hi>Greateſt Rigour</hi> being uſed ſtill towards the <hi>ſobereſt ſort</hi> of people whilſt in the mean time the moſt horrid Enormities, in the World committed by Others, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That,</hi> The publick Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and All <hi>Schools of Learning,</hi> were diſcountenanced unto the Utmoſt.</p>
               <p>And ſeveral more ſuch abominable things, too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to be denied, even by a <hi>Randolphian</hi> impudence it ſelf, are in that Book proved againſt that <hi>unhappy Government.</hi> Nor did that moſt Ancient Sett of the <hi>Phoenician Shepherds,</hi> who ſcrued the Government of <hi>Egypt</hi> into their Hands, as Old <hi>Manethon</hi> tells us, by their <hi>Villanies,</hi> during the Reigns of thoſe Tyrants, make a <hi>Shepherd</hi> more of an <hi>Abomination</hi> to the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in all after-Ages, than theſe <hi>Wolves</hi> under the Name of <hi>Shepherds</hi> have made the Remembrance of their <hi>French Government,</hi> an <hi>Abomination</hi> to all Poſterity among the <hi>New-Englanders:</hi> A <hi>Government,</hi> for which, now, Reader, as faſt as thou wilt, get ready this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph: <q>Nulla quaeſita Scelere Potentia diuturna.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was under the Reſentments of theſe Things, that Sir <hi>Williom Phips,</hi> returned into <hi>England,</hi> in the year 1688. In which <hi>Twice-Wonderful-Year,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Revolution</hi> was wonderfully accompliſhed upon the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that <hi>New-England,</hi> which had been a <hi>Specimen</hi> of what the whole Nation was to look for, might juſtly hope for a ſhare in the General Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Upon this Occaſion Sir <hi>William</hi> offered his beſt Aſſiſtances unto that Eminent Perſon, who a little before this Revolution, betook himſelf unto <hi>White-Hall,</hi> that he might there lay hold on all Opportunities to procure ſome Relief unto the Oppreſſions of that afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Country. But ſeeing the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Affairs in ſo able an Hand, he thought the beſt Stage of <hi>Action</hi> for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50205:18"/>him would now be <hi>New-England</hi> it ſelf; and ſo with certain Inſtructions from none of the leaſt conſiderable Perſons at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> what Service to do for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the Spring of the Year 1689 he haſtened back unto it. Before he left <hi>London,</hi> a Meſſenger from the Abdicated King tender'd him the Government of <hi>New-England,</hi> if he would accept it: But as that excellent Attorney General Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the <hi>Plantations</hi> might be Governed without <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> told the King, <hi>That he could no more Grant a Commiſſion to levy Money on his Subjects there, without their conſent by an Aſſembly, than they could Diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Allegiance to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Crown.</hi> So Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> thought it his Duty to refuſe a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without an Aſſembly,</hi> as a thing that was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it, and inſtead of Petitioning the ſucceeding Princes, that his <hi>Patent</hi> for <hi>High Sheriff</hi> might be rendred Effectual, he joined in Petitions, that <hi>New-England</hi> might have its own Old <hi>Patent</hi> ſo Reſtored, as to render Ineffectual <hi>that,</hi> and all other Grants that might cut ſhort any of it's Ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. But when Sir <hi>William</hi> arrived at <hi>New-England,</hi> he found a New Face of Things; For about an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Indians in the <hi>Eaſtern parts</hi> of the Country, had unaccountably begun a War upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> 1688. and though the Governour then in the <hi>Weſtern Parts,</hi> had immediate Advice of it, yet he not only delayed and neglected all that was neceſſary for the <hi>Publick Defence,</hi> but alſo when he at Laſt returned, he manifeſted a moſt Furious Diſpleaſure againſt thoſe of the Council, and all others that had forwarded any one thing for the ſecurity of the Inhabitants; while at the ſame time, he diſpatched ſome of his Creatures upon ſecret Errands unto <hi>Canada,</hi> and ſet at Liberty ſome of the moſt Murderous <hi>Indians</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſeized upon.</p>
               <p>This Conduct of the Governour, which is in a <hi>Printed</hi> Remonſtrance of ſome of the Beſt Gentlemen in the Council, complained of, did extreamly diſſatisfy the <hi>Suſpicious</hi> People: Who were doubtleſs more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50205:19"/>extream in ſome of their <hi>Suſpicions,</hi> than there was any <hi>real Occaſion</hi> for: But the Governour at length raiſed an Army of a <hi>Thouſand Ergliſh</hi> to Conquer this <hi>Hundred Indians;</hi> and this Army, whereof ſome of the chief Commanders were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> underwent the Fatigues of a Long, and a cold Winter, in the moſt <hi>Caucaſaean</hi> Regions of the Territory, till, without the Killing of <hi>One Indian,</hi> there were more of the poor People Killed, than they had Enemies there Alive! This added, not a Little to the Diſſatisfaction of the People, and it would much more have done ſo if they had ſeen what the World had not <hi>yet</hi> ſeen of the <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> made by the <hi>Iriſh Catholicks</hi> unto the Late King, publiſhed in the Year 1691, In the <hi>Account of the State of the Proteſtants in</hi> Ireland, Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> whereof one Article runs in theſe Expreſs Terms, <hi>That if any of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>cannot have their Lands in Specie, but money in Lieu, ſome of them may Tranſport themſelves into</hi> America, <hi>poſſibly near</hi> New-England, <hi>to check the Growing</hi> Independants <hi>of that Country:</hi> Or if they had ſeen what was afterwards ſeen, in a Letter from K. <hi>James</hi> to His <hi>Holineſs,</hi> (as they ſtile His <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi>) the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> That it was his Full purpoſe to have Set up <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion, in the Engliſh Plantations of <hi>America:</hi> Tho after all, there is cauſe to think, that there was more made of the <hi>Suſpicions</hi> then flying like Wild-fire about the Country, than a ſtrong <hi>Charity</hi> would have Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced. When the People were under theſe <hi>Frights,</hi> they had got by the Edges a Little Intimation of the then Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> glorious Undertaking to deliver <hi>England,</hi> from the <hi>Feared</hi> Evils, which were already <hi>felt</hi> by <hi>New-England;</hi> but when the Perſon, who brought over a Copy of the Princes <hi>Declaration,</hi> was Impriſoned for bringing into the Country a <hi>Treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Paper,</hi> and the Governour, by his Proclamation, Required all Perſons, to uſe their <hi>utmoſt-Endeavours to hinder</hi> the <hi>Landing</hi> of any whom the Prince might ſend thither, <hi>This</hi> put them almoſt out of Patience. And One thing, that plunged the more Conſiderate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50205:19"/>Perſons in the Territory, into uneaſy Thoughts, was the <hi>Faulty Action</hi> of ſome Souldiers, who upon the Common <hi>Suſpicions,</hi> deſerted their <hi>Stations</hi> in the Army, and cauſed their Friends to gather together here and there in Little Bodies, to protect from the Demands of the Governour, their poor Children and Bretheren, whom they thought bound for a <hi>Bloody Sacrifice:</hi> and there were alſo belonging to the <hi>Roſe-Frigat</hi> ſome that Buzz'd ſurprizing ſtories about <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> of many miſchiefs to be thence expected. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſome of the Principal Gentlemen in <hi>Boſton</hi> conſulting what was to be done in this Extraordinary Juncture, They all agreed that they would, if it were poſſible, extinguiſh all Eſſays, in the People towards an <hi>Inſurrection;</hi> in daily Hopes of Orders from <hi>England</hi> for their Safety: but that if the Country People, by any violent motions puſh'd the matter on ſo far, as to make a <hi>Revolution</hi> unavoidable, Then, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſhedding of <hi>Blood</hi> by an ungoverned <hi>Mobile,</hi> ſome of the Gentlemen preſent, ſhould appear at the Head of the <hi>Action,</hi> with a <hi>Declaration</hi> accordingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. By the <hi>eighteenth</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1689. Things were puſhed on ſo far by the People, that certain Perſons firſt Seized the Captain of the <hi>Frigate,</hi> and the Rumor thereof running like Lightning through <hi>Boston,</hi> the whole Town was immediately in Arms, with the moſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimous Reſolution</hi> perhaps, that ever was known to have Inſpir'd any People. They then ſeized thoſe Wretched Men, who by their innumerable <hi>Extortions</hi> and <hi>Abuſes,</hi> had made themſelves the Objects of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Hatred;</hi> not giving over till the <hi>Governour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was become their <hi>Priſoner:</hi> The whole <hi>Action</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing managed without the leaſt <hi>Bloudſhed</hi> or <hi>Plunder,</hi> and with as much <hi>Order</hi> as ever attended any <hi>Tumult,</hi> it may be, in the World. Thus did the <hi>New-England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> aſſert their Title to the Common Rights of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen;</hi> and except the Plantations are willing to Degenerate from the Temper of True <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or except the <hi>Revolution</hi> of the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation be condemned, their <hi>Action</hi> muſt ſo far be juſtified. On
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50205:20"/>their late <hi>Oppreſſors,</hi> now under juſt Confinement, they took no other ſatisfaction, but ſent them over unto <hi>White-Hall,</hi> for the Juſtice of the King and Parliament. And when the Day for the <hi>Anniverſary Election,</hi> by their vacated <hi>Charter</hi> drew near, they had many Debates into what Form they ſhould caſt the Government, which was till then, Adminiſtred by a <hi>Committee for the Conſervation of the Peace,</hi> compoſed of Gentlemen, whoſe <hi>Hap</hi> it was to appear in the Head of the late <hi>Action;</hi> But their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates Iſſued in this Concluſion, That the <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> which were in Power, before the late <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,</hi> ſhould Reſume their Places, and apply themſelves unto the <hi>Conſervation of the Peace,</hi> and put forth what <hi>Acts of Government</hi> the Emergencies might make needful for them, and thus to wait for further Directions from the Authority of <hi>England.</hi> So was there Accompliſhed a <hi>Revolution,</hi> which delivered <hi>New-England</hi> from grievous Oppreſſions, and which was moſt Graciouſly Accepted by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> when it was Reported unto Their Majeſties. But there were New Matters for Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> in a little while, now to think upon.</p>

               <p>BEHOLD the great Things which were done by the Sovereign God, for a Perſon, once, as little in his <hi>own Eyes,</hi> as in <hi>other Men's.</hi> All the Returns which he had hitherto made unto the <hi>God of his Mercies,</hi> were but Preliminaries to what remain to be Related. It has been the Cuſtom in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſtill to expect from ſuch Perſons, as they admitted unto conſtant Communion with them, That they do not only Publickly and Solemnly <hi>Declare</hi> their <hi>Conſent</hi> unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and particularly to thoſe Duties of it, wherein a <hi>particular Church-ſtate</hi> is more immediately concerned, but alſo firſt Relate unto the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and by them unto the <hi>Brethren,</hi> the ſpecial Impreſſions which the <hi>Grace</hi> of God has made upon their Souls in bringing them to this <hi>Conſent.</hi> By this <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Caution,</hi> though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50205:20"/>keep <hi>Hypocrites</hi> from their Sacred Fellowſhip, yet they go as far as they can, to render and preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Churches of Saints,</hi> and they do further very much <hi>Edifie one another.</hi> When Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto his <hi>own Houſe,</hi> he began to bethink himſelf, like <hi>David,</hi> concerning the <hi>Houſe</hi> of the <hi>God,</hi> who had ſurrounded him with ſo many Favours in <hi>his own;</hi> and accordingly he applied himſelf unto the <hi>North Church</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> that with his open Profeſſion of his hearty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he might have the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto his other Enjoyments. One thing that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Reſolution to do what might be in this Matter expected from him, was a Paſſage which he heard from a Miniſter, Preaching on the Title of the <hi>Fifty Firſt</hi> Pſalm: <hi>To make a publick and an open Profeſſion of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is a thing not miſ-becoming the greateſt Man alive. It is an Honour to be found among the Repenting People of God, though they be in Circumſtances never ſo full of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A famous Knight going with other Chriſtians to be Crowned with Martyrdom, obſerved, That his Fellow-Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were in Chains, from which the Sacrificers had, becauſe of his Quality, excus'd him; whereupon he demanded, that he might wear Chains as well as they.</hi> For, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I would be a Knight of that Order too; <hi>There is among our ſelves a repenting People of God, who by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions at their Admiſſions to His Table, do ſignalize their being ſo; and Thanks be to God, that we have ſo little of ſuffering in our Circumſtances. But if any Man count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf grown too big to be a</hi> Knight of that Order, <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf, will one Day be aſhamed of that Man!</hi> Upon this Excitation, Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs unto a <hi>Corgregational-Church,</hi> and he had therein One Thing to propound unto himſelf, which few Perſons of his Age, ſo well ſatisfied in <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> as he was, have then to Ask for. Indeed, in the Primitive Times, although the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> or the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and Pattern of <hi>Scripture</hi> for it, was never ſo much as once made a Queſtion, yet we find <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently delayed by Perſons, upon ſeveral ſuperſtitious
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50205:21"/>and unreaſonable Accounts, againſt which we have ſuch Fathers as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Nyſſen, Baſil, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Ambroſe,</hi> and others, employing a variety of Argument. But Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> had hitherto delayed his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe the Years of his Child-hood were ſpent where there was no ſettled Miniſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he was now not only willing to attain a good Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his own Internal and Practical <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> before his receiving that <hi>Mark</hi> thereof, but he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo willing to receive it among thoſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that ſeemed moſt ſenſible of the <hi>Bonds</hi> which it laid them under.

At length God was pleaſed to ſmile upon my <hi>Outward
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50205:21"/>Concerns.</hi> The various <hi>Providences</hi> both Merciful and Afflictive, which attended me in my Travels were ſanctified unto me, to make me <hi>Acknowledge God in all my Ways.</hi> I have Divers Times been in Danger of my <hi>Life,</hi> and I have been brought to ſee that I owe my <hi>Life</hi> to Him that has given a <hi>Life</hi> ſo often to me: I thank God, He hath brought me to ſee my ſelf altogether unhappy, without an Intereſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to cloſe heartily with him, deſiring Him to Execute <hi>All His Offices</hi> on my Behalf. I have now, for ſome Time, been under ſerious <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> that I would avoid whatever I ſhould know to be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto God, and that I would <hi>Serve Him all the Days of my Life.</hi> I Believe <hi>No man will Repent the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſuch a Maſter.</hi> I find my ſelf <hi>unable</hi> to Keep ſuch <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> but my Serious <hi>Prayers</hi> are to the Moſt High, that <hi>He</hi> would <hi>enable</hi> me. God hath done ſo much for me that I am ſenſible, I owe my ſelf to Him; <hi>To Him would I give my ſelf, and all that He has given to me.</hi> I can't expreſs His Mercies to me. But, as ſoon as ever God had ſmiled upon me, with a Turn of my Affairs, I laid my ſelf under the VOWS of the Lord <hi>That I would ſet my ſelf to ſerve His People, and Churches here unto the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tmoſt of my Capacity.</hi> I have had great Offers made me in <hi>England;</hi> But the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> were thoſe, which my Heart was moſt ſet upon.

It has been my Trouble, that ſince I came home I have made no more Haſt to get into the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> where <hi>I deſire to be:</hi> Eſpecially having Heard ſo much about the <hi>Evil</hi> of that Omiſſion. I can Do little for God, but I deſire to Wait upon Him in His Ordinances, and to Live to His Honour and Glory. My being Born in a part of the Country, where I had not in my <hi>Infancy</hi> enjoyed the <hi>Firſt Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>New-Teſtement,</hi> has been ſomthing of a <hi>Stumbling Block</hi> unto me.

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50205:22"/>elſewhere made unto me, I Reſolved rather to Deferr it, until I might enjoy it in the Communion of theſe Churches, And I have had awful Impreſſions from thoſe Words of the Lord Jeſus, in Matth. 8.38. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my Words, of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed.</hi> When God had Bleſſed me with ſomething of the World, I had no Trouble ſo Great as this; <hi>Leſt it ſhould not be in Mercy;</hi> and I Trembled at Nothing more than being <hi>put off with a Portion here.</hi> That I may make ſure of <hi>Better Things</hi> I now offer my ſelf unto the Communion of this' Church of the Lord JESUS.</q>

               <p>SEVERAL Times, about, before and after <hi>this Time,</hi> did I hear him expreſs himſelf unto this purpoſe: <hi>I have no need at all, to look after any further Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for my ſelf in this World; I may ſit ſtill at home, if I will, and enjoy my Eaſe for the reſt of my Life; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I ſhould offend God in my doing ſo: For I am now in the prime of my Age and Strength, and, I thank God, I can undergo Hardſhip: He only knows how long I have to live; but I think 'tis my Duty to venture my Life in doing of Good, before an uſeleſs Old Age comes upon me: Wherefore I will now expoſe my ſelf, while I am able, and as far as I am able, for the Service of my Country: I was born for Others, as well as my ſelf.</hi> I ſay, many a time have I heard him ſo expreſs himſelf: And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this Generous <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>Reſolution,</hi> was all the reſt of his Life. About this time <hi>New-England</hi> was miſerably <hi>Briar'd,</hi> in the Perplexities of an <hi>Indian War;</hi> and the Salvages, in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> part of the Country, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing

The <hi>New-Erglanders</hi> found, that while they continued only on the <hi>Defenſive</hi> part, their <hi>People</hi> were thinned, and their <hi>Treaſures</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, without any hopes of ſeeing a Period put unto the <hi>Indian Tragedies;</hi> nor could an Army greater than <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi>'s have eaſily come at the ſeemingly contemptible Handful of <hi>Tawnies,</hi> which made all this Diſturbance; Or, <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> the greateſt Conqueror that ever the World ſaw, have made it a Buſineſs of no <hi>Trouble</hi> to have <hi>Conquered</hi> them: They found; that they were like to make no Weapons reach their Enſwamped Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, except Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> could have ſhown them how

Whereupon they made a <hi>Firſt Eſſay</hi> againſt the <hi>French,</hi> by ſending a Naval Force, with about Seven Hundred Men, under the Conduct of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> againſt <hi>L'Acady</hi> and <hi>Nova Scotia;</hi> of which Action we ſhall give only this General and Summary Account; That Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> ſet Sail from <hi>Nantaſcot, April</hi> 28. 1690. Arriving at <hi>Port-Royal, May</hi> 11. and had the Fort quickly Surrender'd into his Hands by the <hi>French</hi> Enemy, who deſpaired of holding
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50205:23"/>out againſt him. He then took Poſſeſſion of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, and having Demoliſhed the Fort, and ſent away the Garriſon, Adminiſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Planters an <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he left what Order he thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Government of the Place, until further Order ſhould be taken by the Governour and Council of the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi>-Colony, unto whom he returned <hi>May</hi> 30, with an acceptable Account of his Expedition, and accepted a Place among the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of that Colony, to which the <hi>Free-Men</hi> had choſen him, at their <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Election,</hi> two Days before,</p>
               <p>Thus the Country, once given by King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, unto Sir <hi>William Alexander,</hi> was now by another Sir <hi>William,</hi> recovered out of the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who had afterwards got the Poſſeſſion of it; and there was added unto the <hi>Engliſh Empire,</hi> a Territory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no Man can Read Monſieur <hi>Denys's Deſcription Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphique &amp; Hiſtorique des Coſtes de l' Amerique Septentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onale,</hi> but he muſt reckon the Conqueſt of a Region ſo Improvable, for <hi>Lumber,</hi> for <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> for <hi>Mines,</hi> and for <hi>Furrs,</hi> a very conſiderable <hi>Service.</hi> But if a ſmaller <hi>Service</hi> has, e'er-now, ever merited a <hi>Knighthood,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> was willing to Repeat his Merits, by Actions of the greateſt <hi>Service</hi> poſſible: <q>Nil Actum credens, ſi quid ſupereſſet agendum.</q>

               <p>THE Addition of this <hi>French</hi> Colony to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dominion, was no more than a <hi>little ſtep</hi> towards a <hi>greater Action,</hi> which was firſt in the Deſign of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> and which was, indeed, the <hi>Greateſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that ever the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> Attempted.

               <p>It was <hi>Canada</hi> that was the chief Source of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Miſeries. <hi>There</hi> was the main Strength of the <hi>French; There</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> were moſtly ſupplied with Ammunition; <hi>Thence</hi> Iſſued Parties of Men, who uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Salvages, barbarouſly murdered many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>New-Enlanders,</hi> without any Provocation on the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> part, except this, that <hi>New-England</hi> had Proclaimed King <hi>William,</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> which they ſaid were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers;</hi> And, as <hi>Cato</hi> could make no Speech in the Senate, without that Concluſion, <hi>Delenda eſt Carthago;</hi> ſo it was the general Concluſion of all that Argued ſenſibly, about the ſafety of that Country, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada muſt be Reduced.</hi> It then became the concurring Reſolution of all <hi>New-England,</hi> with <hi>New-York,</hi> to make a Vigorous Attack upon <hi>Canada</hi> at once, both by Sea and Land.</p>
               <p>And a Fleet was accordingly fitted out from <hi>Boſton,</hi> under the Command of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> to fall upon <hi>Quebeque,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Canada.</hi> They waited until <hi>Auguſt</hi> for ſome Stores of War from <hi>England,</hi> whither they had ſent for that purpoſe, early in the Spring;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50205:24"/>but none at laſt arriving, and the Seaſon of the Year being ſo far ſpent, Sir <hi>William</hi> could not, without many Diſcouragements upon his Mind, proceed in a Voyage, for which he found himſelf ſo poorly provided. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Ships being taken up, and the Men on board, his uſual Courage would not permit him to Deſiſt from the Enterprize; but he ſet Sail from <hi>Hull</hi> near <hi>Boſton, Auguſt</hi> 9. 1690. with a Fleet of <hi>Thirty two</hi> Ships and Tenders; whereof one, called <hi>the Six Friends,</hi> carrying Fourty Four great Guns, and Two Hundred Men, was <hi>Admiral.</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> dividing the Fleet into ſeveral Squadrons, whereof there was <hi>the Six Friends,</hi> Captain <hi>Gregory Sugars</hi> Commander, with Eleven more of the Admiral's Squadron, of which one was alſo a Capital Ship, namely, <hi>The John and Thomas,</hi> Captain <hi>Thomas Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Commander; Of the <hi>Vice-Admirals,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Thomas Gilbert</hi> Commander, with Nine more; Of the <hi>Rear-Admirals,</hi> the <hi>America-Merchant,</hi> Captain <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Eldridge</hi> Commander, with Nine more; and above Twenty Hundred Men on Board the whole Fleet: He ſo happily managed his Charge, that they every one of them Arrived ſafe at Anchor before <hi>Quebeck,</hi> although they had as dangerous, and almoſt untrodden a <hi>Path,</hi> to take <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Piloted,</hi> for the whole Voyage, as ever any Voyage was undertaken with. Some ſmall <hi>French Prizes</hi> he took by the way, and ſet up <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours upon the Coaſt, here and there, as he went along; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was out, he had ſpent ſeveral Days as far onward of his Voyage, as between the Iſland of <hi>Antecoſta,</hi> and the <hi>Main.</hi> But when they entred the mighty River of <hi>Canada,</hi> ſuch adverſe Winds encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Fleet, that they were <hi>Three Weeks</hi> diſpatching the way, which might otherwiſe have been gone in <hi>Three Days,</hi> and it was the Fifth of <hi>October,</hi> when a freſh Breeze coming up at <hi>Eaſt,</hi> carried them along by the <hi>North</hi> Shore, up to the Iſle of <hi>Orleans;</hi> and then haling <hi>Southerly,</hi> they paſſed by the <hi>Eaſt</hi> end of that Iſland, with the whole Fleet approaching the City of <hi>Quebeck.</hi> This loſs of Time, which made it ſo late before the Fleet could get into the Country, where a cold and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50205:24"/>fierce <hi>Winter</hi> was already very far advanced, gave no very <hi>good</hi> Proſpect of Succeſs to the Expedition; but that which gave a much <hi>worſe,</hi> was a moſt horrid <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management,</hi> which had, the mean while, happened in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> For a Thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>New-York,</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> and <hi>Connecticut,</hi> with Fifteen Hundred <hi>Indians,</hi> were to have gone over-Land, in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and fallen upon <hi>Mount-Royal,</hi> while the Fleet was to Viſit <hi>Quebeck</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and no Expedition could have been better laid than <hi>This,</hi> which was thus contrived. But thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> marching as far as the great Lake that was to be paſſed, found their <hi>Canoos</hi> not provided, according to expectation; and the <hi>Indians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were [<hi>How?</hi> God knows, and will one Day Judge!] diſſuaded from Joining with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the Army met with ſuch Diſcouragements, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>Had this <hi>Weſtern Army</hi> done but ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at the <hi>Lake,</hi> the Diverſion thereby given to the <hi>French</hi> Quartered at <hi>Mount-Royal,</hi> would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Conqueſt of <hi>Quebeck</hi> ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50205:26"/>that ran a Ground upon the <hi>North</hi>-Shoar, near two Miles from <hi>Quebeck,</hi> and could not get off, but lay in the ſame Diſtreſs that <hi>Scaeva</hi> did, when the <hi>Britans</hi> pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their Numbers upon the <hi>Bark,</hi> wherein he, with a few more Soldiers of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army, were by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the <hi>Tide,</hi> left aſhoar: The <hi>French,</hi> with <hi>Indians,</hi> that ſaw them ly there, came near, and Fired thick upon them, and were bravely Anſwered; and when two or three Hundred of the Enemy, at laſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Field-Piece againſt the <hi>Bark,</hi> while the Wind blew ſo hard, that no help could be ſent unto his Men, the General Advanced ſo far, as to Level two or three great Guns, conveniently enough to make the Aſſailants Fly; and when the Flood came, the Bark happily got off, without the hurt of one Man aboard. But ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent was the Storm of Wind all this Day, that it was not poſſible for them to Land, until the Eighth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> when, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> counting every <hi>Hour</hi> to be a <hi>Week,</hi> until they were come to Battle, vigorouſly got aſhoar, deſigning to enter the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-end of the City. The <hi>Small-Pox</hi> had got into the Eleet, by which Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per prevailing, the number of Effective Men which now went aſhoar, under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Walley,</hi> did not amount unto more than Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Hundred; but Four Companies of theſe were drawn out as <hi>Forlorns,</hi> whom, on every ſide, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my fired at; nevertheleſs, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ruſhing with a ſhout, at once upon them, cauſed them to Run, as faſt as Legs could carry them: So that the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, expreſſing as much Reſolution as was in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army, when they firſt landed on <hi>Britai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But ſome thought, that by <hi>ſtaying in the Valley,</hi> they took the way <hi>never to get over the Hill:</hi> And yet for them to ſtay where they were, till the ſmaller Veſſels came up the River, before them, ſo far
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50205:26"/>as by their Guns to ſecure the Paſſage of the Army, in their <hi>getting over,</hi> was what the Council of War had ordered. But the Violence of the <hi>Weather,</hi> with the General's being ſooner plunged into the heat of Action than was intended, hindred the ſmaller Veſſels from attending that Order. And this Evening, a <hi>French</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter coming to them, aſſured them, that Nine Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men were on their March from <hi>Quebeck</hi> to meet them, already paſſed a little Rivulet that lay at the end of the City, but ſeeing them Land ſo ſuddenly, and ſo valiantly run down thoſe that firſt Encountred them, they had Retreated: Nevertheleſs, That Count <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenac</hi> was come down to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> with no fewer than <hi>Thirty Hundred</hi> Men to defend the City, having left but <hi>fifty</hi> Souldiers to defend <hi>Mount Real,</hi> becauſe they had underſtood, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army on that ſide, were gone back to <hi>Albany.</hi> Notwithſtanding this diſpiriting Information, the common Souldiers did with much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency Beg and Pray, that they might be Led on, profeſſing, that they had rather loſe their Lives on the ſpot, than fail of taking the City; but the more wary Commanders, conſidered how raſh a thing it would be, for about Fourteen Hundred Raw Men, tired with a long Voyage, to aſſault more than Twice as many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Souldiers, who were <hi>Galli in ſuo ſterquilinio,</hi> or <hi>Cocks Crowing on their own Dunghil.</hi> They were, in truth, now gotten into the grievous Caſe, which <hi>Livy</hi> deſcribes, when he ſays, <hi>Ibi grave eſt Bellum gerere, ubi non conſiſtendi aut procedendi locus; quocunque aspexeris Hoſtilia ſunt omnia;</hi> Look on one ſide or 'tother, all was full of <hi>Hoſtile Difficulties.</hi> And indeed, whatever Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Clamour has been made againſt any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, it is apparent, that they acted conſiderately, in making a <hi>Pauſe</hi> upon what was before them; and they did a greater kindneſs to their Souldiers than they have ſince been thanked for. But in this time, General <hi>Phips</hi> and his Men of War, with their <hi>Canvas, Wings,</hi> flew cloſe up unto the Weſt-end of the City, and there he behaved himſelf with the Greateſt Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imaginable; nor did the other Men of War forbear
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50205:27"/>to follow his brave Example: who never diſcovered himſelf more in his Element, than when (as the Poet expreſſeth it,)
<q>
                     <l>The Slaughter-Breathing Braſs grew hot, and ſpoke</l>
                     <l>In Flames of Lightning, and in Clouds of Smoke:</l>

               </p>
               <p>He lay within <hi>Piſtol-ſhot</hi> of the Enemies Cannon, and beat them from thence, and very much Batter'd the Town, having his own Ship ſhot through in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places, with <hi>four and twenty Pounders,</hi> and yet, but one Man was killed, and only two mortally wounded aboard him, in this hot Engagement, which continued the greateſt part of that Night, and ſeveral hours of the Day enſuing. But wondring, that he ſaw no <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of any Effective Action aſhoar, at the Eaſt end of the City, he ſent that he might know the condition of the Army there; and received Anſwer, That ſeveral of the Men were ſo frozen in their Hands and Feet, as to be diſabled from ſervice, and others were apace fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick of the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> Whereupon he order'd them on Board immediately to refreſh themſelves, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended then, to have renew'd his Attack upon the City, in the Method of Landing his Men in the face of it, under the ſhelter of his Great Guns; having to that purpoſe, provided alſo, a conſderable number of well-ſhaped <hi>Wheel-Barrows,</hi> each of them carrying Two <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarraro</hi>'s a piece, to March before the Men and make the Enemy fly, with as much Contempt as overwhelmed the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> when undone by <hi>Foxes</hi> with <hi>Torches</hi> in their Tails; (remembred in an Anniverſary Diverſion, every <hi>April,</hi> among the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> taught by the <hi>Phenicians.</hi>)</p>
               <p>While the Meaſures to be further taken, were debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there was made an Exchange of Priſoners, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having taken ſeveral of the <hi>French</hi> in divers acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>French</hi> having in their Hands divers of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom the <hi>Indians</hi> had brought Captives unto them. The Army now on Board, continued ſtill Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Couragious, and on fire, for the Conqueſt of

                  <hi>Quebeck,</hi> or if they had miſſed of doing it by ſtorm, they knew that they might, by poſſeſſing themſelves of the Iſle of <hi>Orleans,</hi> in a little while, have ſtarved them out. Incredible Damage they might indeed, have done to the Enemy, before they Embarked, but they were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to preſerve the more undefenſible parts of the Country, in ſuch a condition, as might more ſenſibly encourage the Submiſſion of the Inhabitants, unto the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Protection was deſired by ſo many of them. And ſtill they were loth to Play for any leſſer Game than the immediate Surrender of <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> it ſelf. But e're a full <hi>Council of War</hi> could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the next ſteps to be taken, a violent <hi>Storm</hi> aroſe, that ſeparated the Fleet, and the <hi>Snow</hi> and the Cold became ſo extreme, that they could not continue in thoſe Quarters any longer.</p>
               <p>Thus, by an evident <hi>Hand of Heaven,</hi> ſending one unavoidable Diſaſter after another, as well-formed an Enterprize, as perhaps was ever made by the <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> moſt unhappily miſcarried; and General <hi>Phips</hi> underwent a very mortifying Diſappointment of a Deſign, which his Mind was, as much as ever any, ſet upon. He arrived <hi>Nov,</hi> 19. at <hi>Boston,</hi> where, although he found himſelf, as well as the Publick, thrown into very <hi>uneaſie</hi> circumſtances, yet he had this to comfort him, That neither his Courage, nor his Conduct could reaſonably have been Taxed, nor could it be ſaid that any Man could have done more than he did, under ſo many <hi>Embaraſſments of his Buſineſs,</hi> as he was to fight withal. He alſo relieved the uneaſineſs of his Mind, by conſidering, that his Voyage to <hi>Canada,</hi> diverted from his Country an <hi>Horrible Tempest</hi> from an Army of <hi>Boſs-Lopers,</hi> which had prepar'd themſelves, as 'tis affirmed, that Winter, to fall upon the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and by falling on them, would probably have laid no little part of the Country deſolate. And he further conſidered, That in this matter, like <hi>Iſrael</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging againſt <hi>Benjamin,</hi> it may be, we ſaw yet, but the <hi>beginning</hi> of the matter: And that the way to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> now being learnt, the foundation of a Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50205:28"/>it might be laid, in what had been already done. Unto this purpoſe likewiſe, he was heard ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Remarkable Story, reported by <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine.</hi>

               <p>FROM The time that General <hi>Pen</hi> made his Attempt upon <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> with an Army that, like the <hi>New Engliſh</hi> Forces, againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> miſcarried after an Expectation of having Little to Do, but to <hi>Poſſeſs and Plunder;</hi> Even to this Day, the General Diſaſter which hath attended, almoſt every Attempt of the <hi>European</hi> Colones in <hi>America,</hi> to make any Conſiderable Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon their Neighbours, is a matter of ſome cloſe Reflection. But of the Diſaſter, which now befell poor <hi>New-England,</hi> in particular, every one will eaſily Conclude, none of the leaſt Conſequences to have been, the <hi>Extreme Debts,</hi> which that Country was now plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into; there being <hi>Forty Thouſand</hi> pounds, more or leſs, now to be paid, and not a Penny in the Treaſury to pay it withal. In this <hi>Extremity,</hi> they preſently found out an <hi>Expedient,</hi> which may ſerve as an <hi>Example,</hi> for any People, in other parts of the World, whoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes may call for a ſudden ſupply of <hi>Money</hi> to carry them through any Important <hi>Expedition.</hi> The <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> firſt paſs'd <hi>an Act,</hi> for the Levying of ſuch a ſum of <hi>Money</hi> as was wanted, within ſuch a Term of Time, as was judged convenient; and this <hi>Act</hi> was a <hi>Fund,</hi> on which the <hi>Credit</hi> of ſuch a Sum, ſhould be rendered <hi>paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> among the people. Hereupon, there was appointed an Able and Faithful <hi>Committee</hi> of Gentlemen, who prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Copper-Plates,</hi> a juſt Number of <hi>Bills,</hi> and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, Indented, and Contrived them, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to make it Impoſſible to Counterfeit any of them, without a Speedy Diſcovery of the <hi>Counterfeit:</hi> beſides which, they were all Signed by the Hands of <hi>Three,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>Committee.</hi> Theſe <hi>Bills</hi> being of ſeveral Sums, from <hi>Two-ſhillings,</hi> to <hi>Ten pounds,</hi> did confeſs the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſet-Colony,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50205:29"/>to be <hi>Endebted</hi> unto the Perſon, in whoſe Hands they were, the Sums therein expreſſed; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was made, that if any <hi>particular Bills,</hi> were Irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably Loſt or Torn, or Worn by the Owners, they might be Recruited without any Damage to the <hi>whole in General.</hi> The <hi>publick Debts</hi> to the <hi>Sailors</hi> and <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> now upon the point of <hi>Mutiny,</hi> (for, <hi>Arma Tenenti, Omnia dat, qui Juſta negat!</hi>) were in theſe <hi>Bills</hi> paid immediatly: but that further <hi>Credit</hi> might be given thereunto, it was Ordered that they ſhould be Accepted by the Treaſurer, and all Officers that were Subordinate unto him, in all <hi>publick Payments,</hi> at Five <hi>per cent.</hi> more than the Value expreſſed in them. The People knowing that the <hi>Tax-Act,</hi> would, in the Space of Two years at Leaſt, fetch into the Treaſury, as much as all the <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> thence emitted would amount unto, were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be furniſhed with <hi>Bills,</hi> wherein, 'twas their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to pay their <hi>Taxes,</hi> rather than in any other <hi>Specie,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Sailors</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> put off their <hi>Bills,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Money,</hi> to thoſe, with whom they had any Dealings, and they <hi>circulated</hi> through all the Hands in the Colony, pretty Comfortably. Had the <hi>Government</hi> been ſo Settled, that there had not bin any Doubt of any Obſtruction, or Diverſion to be given to the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Tax-Act,</hi> by a <hi>Total Change</hi> of their affairs, then Depending at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> 'Tis very certain, that the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> had been better than ſo much ready <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> yea, the <hi>Invention</hi> had been of more Uſe to the <hi>New-Englanders,</hi> than if all their <hi>Copper Mines</hi> had been opened, or the Mountains of <hi>Peru</hi> had been Removed into theſe parts of <hi>America.</hi> The <hi>Maſſachuſet Bills of Credit,</hi> had been like the <hi>Bank-Bills</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> where though there were not, perhaps, a <hi>Ducat</hi> of Money in the <hi>Bank,</hi> yet the <hi>Bills</hi> were eſteemed more then Twenty <hi>per cent.</hi> better than Money, among the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in all their Dealings. But many People being afraid, that the Government would in Half a year, be ſo Overturned, as to Convert their <hi>Bills, of Credit</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together into <hi>Waſt-paper,</hi> the <hi>Credit</hi> of them was thereby very much impaired; and they, who firſt received them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50205:29"/>could make them yield little more than <hi>fourteen</hi> or <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> ſhillings in the Pound; from whence there aroſe thoſe Idle <hi>Suſpicions</hi> in the Heads of many more Ignorant and Unthinking Folks concerning the Uſe thereof, which to the Incredible Detriment of the Province, are not wholly laid aſide unto this Day. However, this Method of paying the <hi>Publick Debts,</hi> did no leſs than ſave the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, from a perfect Ruine: and e're many Months were expired, the Governour and Council had the pleaſure of ſeeing the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> burn before their Eyes, many a Thouſand Pounds Worth of the <hi>Bills,</hi> which had paſſed about until they were again Returned unto the Treaſury, but before their being returned, had happily and honeſtly, without a farthing of <hi>ſilver Coin,</hi> diſcharged the <hi>Debts,</hi> for which they were intended. But that which helped theſe <hi>Bills</hi> unto much of their <hi>Credit,</hi> was the generous offer of many worthy men in <hi>Boſton,</hi> to run the Riſque of ſelling their <hi>Goods</hi> reaſonably for them: and of theſe, I think, I may ſay, that General <hi>Phips</hi> was in ſome ſort the <hi>Leader;</hi> who at the very Beginning, meerly to Recommend the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Bills</hi> unto other Perſons, cheerfully laid down a Conſiderable Quantity of <hi>ready Money</hi> for an equivalent parcel of them. And thus in a little time, the Country waded through the Terrible <hi>Debts</hi> which it was fallen into: In <hi>this,</hi> though unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py enough, yet not ſo unhappy, as in the <hi>Loſs of men,</hi> by which the Country was at the ſome Time conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. 'Tis True, there was very <hi>Little Blood</hi> ſpilt in the Attacque made upon <hi>Quebeck;</hi> and there was a <hi>Great Hand</hi> of Heaven ſeen in it. The Churches, upon the Call of the Government, not only obſerved a General <hi>Faſt</hi> through the Colony, for the Welfare of the Army ſent unto <hi>Quebeck,</hi> but alſo kept the <hi>Wheel of Prayer</hi> in a <hi>Continual motion,</hi> by Repeated and Succeſſive Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for Days of <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Faſting,</hi> in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vicinities. On theſe Days the Ferventeſt Prayers were ſent up to the <hi>God of Armies,</hi> for the ſafety and ſucceſs of the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Army gone to <hi>Canada;</hi> and though I never underſtood that any of the Faithful did in their <hi>Prayers</hi> ariſe to any aſſurance, that the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50205:30"/>ſhould <hi>proſper in all reſpects,</hi> yet they ſometimes in their Devotions on theſe Occaſions, uttered their Perſwaſion, that Almighty God had heard them in <hi>this</hi> thing, <hi>that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Army ſhould not fall by the hands of the</hi> French <hi>Enemy.</hi> Now they were marvellouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from doing <hi>ſo;</hi> though the Enemy had ſuch unexpected Advantages over them, yea, and though the horrid <hi>Winter</hi> was come on ſo far, that it is a Wonder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, then Riding in the River of <hi>Canada,</hi> fared any better than the Army which a while ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Poland,</hi> wherein, of <hi>ſeventy thouſand</hi> Invaders, no leſs than <hi>forty thouſand</hi> ſuddenly periſhed by the ſeverity of the <hi>cold,</hi> albeit it were but the Month of <hi>November</hi> with them. Nevertheleſs, a kind of <hi>Camp-Fever,</hi> as well as the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> got into the Fleet, whereby ſome Hundreds came ſhort of Home. And beſides this Calamity, it was alſo to be lamented, That although the moſt of the Fleet arrived ſafe at <hi>New-England,</hi> whereof ſome Veſſels indeed were driven off by Croſs-Winds as far as the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> before ſuch Arrival; yet there were three or four Veſſels which totally miſcarried: <hi>One</hi> was never heard of, a <hi>ſecond</hi> was Wreck'd, but moſt of the Men were ſaved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in company; a <hi>third</hi> was Wreck'd ſo, that all the Men were either ſtarved or drown'd, or ſlain by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> except <hi>one,</hi> which a long while after, was, by means of the <hi>French,</hi> reſtored: And a <hi>fourth,</hi> met with Accidents, which it may be, my Reader will, by and by pronounce, not unworthy to have been Related.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Brigantine,</hi> whereof Captain <hi>John Rainsford</hi> was Commander, having about Threeſcore Men aboard, was in a very ſtormy Night, <hi>Octob.</hi> 28, 1690, ſtranded upon the deſolate and hideous Iſland of <hi>Antecoſta,</hi> an Iſland in the mouth of the Mighty River of <hi>Canada;</hi> but through the ſingular Mercy of God unto them, the Veſſel did not, immediately, ſtave to pieces, which if it had happened, they muſt have, one way or another quickly periſhed. There they lay for divers days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abundance of bitter Weather, trying and hoping to get off their Veſſel; and they ſolemnly ſet apart,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50205:30"/>one Day for <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Faſting,</hi> to obtain the ſmiles of Heaven upon them, in the midſt of their Diſtreſſes; and this eſpecially, That if they muſt go aſhoar, they might not by any ſtreſs of Storm, loſe the <hi>Proviſions</hi> which they were to carry with them. They were, at laſt convinced, that they muſt continue no longer on Board, and therefore, by the ſeventh of <hi>November,</hi> they applied themſelves, all Hands, to get their <hi>Proviſions</hi> aſhoar upon the diſmal <hi>Iſland,</hi> where they had nothing but a ſad and cold Winter before them; which being accompliſhed, their Veſſel <hi>overſett</hi> ſo, as to take away from them all expectation of getting off the Iſland in it.

               <p>But it was not long before they began to feel the more mortal effects of the Straits, whereinto they had bin Reduced: Their <hi>ſhort</hi> Commons, Their Drink of <hi>Snow-Water,</hi> Their Hard and Wet, and Smoaky <hi>Lodgings,</hi> and their Grievous <hi>Deſpair of Mind,</hi> overwhelmed ſome of them, at ſuch a Rate, and ſo <hi>ham-ſtring'd</hi> them, that ſooner than be at the paines to go abroad, and cut their one Fuel, they would ly after a Sottiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Cold; theſe things quickly brought <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> among them. The firſt of their Number who Died, was their <hi>Doctor,</hi> on the 20th <hi>of December;</hi> and then they dropt away, one after another, till between <hi>thirty</hi> and <hi>forty</hi> of the <hi>ſixty,</hi> were buried by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Friends, whereof every one look'd ſtill to be the next that ſhould lay his Bones in that Forſaken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Theſe poor Men did therefore, on <hi>Monday</hi> the Twenty Seventh of <hi>January,</hi> keep a <hi>Sacred Fast</hi> (as they did, in ſome ſort, a <hi>civil</hi> one, every day, all this while) to beſeech of Almighty God, that his <hi>Anger</hi> might be turned from them, That he would not go on to cut them off in his <hi>Anger,</hi> That the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Seaſon might be mitigated, and, That they might be proſpered in ſome Eſſay to get Relief as the <hi>Spring</hi> ſhould Advance upon them; and they took <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> That God gave them a Gracious Anſwer to every one of theſe Petitions.</p>

               <p>Whatever <hi>Penalties</hi> they Enacted for other Crimes, there was One, for which, like that of <hi>Parricide</hi> among the Ancients, they would have promiſed themſelves, that there ſhould not have been Occaſion for any <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;</hi> and that was, the Crime of <hi>Stealing</hi> from the Common-Stock of their Proviſions.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50205:31"/>Children of <hi>the Leviathan,</hi> while it was not poſſible for them to preſerve their feeble Store-Houſe from the <hi>Stone-Wall-breaking</hi> Madneſs of theſe unreaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This Trade of <hi>ſtealirg,</hi> if it had not been ſtop'd, by ſome <hi>exemplary Severity,</hi> they muſt in a little while, by <hi>Lot</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> have come to have <hi>Canibally</hi> devoured One Another; for there was nothing to be done, either at <hi>Fiſhing</hi> or <hi>Fowling</hi> or <hi>Hunting</hi> upon that Rueful Iſland, in the Depth of a Frozen Winter; and though they ſent, as far as they could upon Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they could not find, on the Iſland, any <hi>Living thing</hi> in the World, beſides themſelves. Wherefore, though by an <hi>Act,</hi> they made <hi>ſtealing</hi> to be ſo <hi>Criminal,</hi> that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral did Run the <hi>Gantlet</hi> for it, yet, they were not far from being driven after all, to make One Degree and Inſtance of it, <hi>Capital.</hi> There was a wicked <hi>Iriſhman</hi> among them, who had ſuch a <hi>Voracious Devil</hi> in him, that after divers <hi>Burglaries</hi> upon the <hi>Store-houſe,</hi> committed by him, at laſt, he <hi>ſtole,</hi> and <hi>Eat</hi> with ſuch a <hi>Pamphagous Fury,</hi> as to Cram himſelf with no leſs than <hi>Eighteen Biskets,</hi> at one <hi>ſtolen meal,</hi> and he was fain to have his Belly ſtrok'd and Bath'd before the Fire, leſt he ſhould otherwiſe have burſt. This Amazing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed murderous Villany of the <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> brought them all to their Wit's Ends, how to defend themſelves from the Ruine therein threatned unto them; and whatever <hi>methods</hi> were propoſed, it was feared, that there could be no ſtop given to his <hi>Furacious</hi> Exorbitancies, any Way but <hi>One;</hi> He could not be paſt <hi>Stealing,</hi> unleſs he were paſt <hi>Eating</hi> too. Some think therefore, they might have Sentenced the Wretch to Dye, and after they had been at pains, upon Chriſtian and Spiritual Accounts, to prepare him for it, have executed the Sentence, by ſhooting him to Death: concluding matters come to that paſs, that if <hi>they</hi> had not ſhot him, he muſt have <hi>Starved</hi> them unavoidably. Such an Action if it were done, will doubtleſs meet with no harder a Cenſure, than that of the ſeven <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, who
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50205:32"/>being in a Boat carried off to Sea, from St. <hi>Chriſtopher's,</hi> with but <hi>one</hi> Days Proviſion aboard for <hi>Seventeen,</hi> Singled out ſome of their Number by Lot and ſlew them, and Eat them; for which, when they were afterwards accuſed of <hi>Murder,</hi> the Court, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>inevitable Neceſſity,</hi> acquitted them. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>inevitable neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Starving,</hi> without ſuch an Action, ſufficiently grievous to them all, will very much plead for what was done (whatever it were!) by theſe poor <hi>Antecostians.</hi> And <hi>starved</hi> indeed, they muſt have been, for all this, if they had not Contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Performed a very deſperate Adventure, which now remains to be Related. There was a very dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive kind of Boat belonging to their <hi>Brigantine,</hi> which they recovered out of the Wreck, and cutting this Boat in Two, they made a ſhift with certain odd Materials preſerved among them, to lengthen it ſo far, that they could therein form a <hi>little Cuddy,</hi> where Two or Three Men might be ſtowed, and they ſet up a <hi>little Maſt,</hi> whereto they faſtned a little Sail, and accommodated it with ſome other <hi>little circumstances,</hi> according to their preſent poor Capacity.</p>
               <p>On the Twenty Fifth of <hi>March,</hi> Five of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Shipped themſelves upon this Doughty <hi>Fly-Boat,</hi> intending, if it were poſſible, to carry unto <hi>Boſton,</hi> the Tidings of their woful Plight upon <hi>Antecosta,</hi> and by help from their Friends there, to return with ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuccours for the reſt. They had not Sail'd long, before they were Hemm'd in by prodigious Cakes of Ice, whereby their Boat ſometimes was horribly wounded, and it was a Miracle, that it was not Cruſh'd into a <hi>Thouſand pieces,</hi> if indeed a <hi>thouſand pieces</hi> could have been Splintred out of ſo minute a <hi>Cock-Boat.</hi> They kept labouring, and fearfully Weather-beaten, among enormous Rands of Ice, which would ever now and then rub formidably upon them, and were enough to have broken the Ribs of the ſtrongeſt Frigat that ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut the Seas; and yet the ſignal Hand of Heaven ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50205:32"/>preſerved this petty Boat, that by the Eleventh of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> they had got a quarter of their way, and came to an Anchor under Cape St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> having ſeen Land but <hi>once</hi> before, and that about ſeven Leagues off, ever ſince their firſt ſetting out; and yet, having ſeen the <hi>open</hi> and <hi>Ocean Sea, not ſo much as once,</hi> in all this while, for the Ice that ſtill encompaſſed them. For their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in this Time, the little Proviſions they brought with them, would not have kept them alive; only they killed <hi>Seale</hi> upon the Ice, and they melted the upper pare of the Ice for Drink; but fierce, wild, ugly <hi>Sea-Horſes,</hi> would often ſo approach them upon the Ice, that the fear of being devoured by them, was not the leaſt of their Exerciſes. The Day following, they weighed Anchor, betimes in the Morning; but the <hi>Norweſt Winds</hi> perſecuted them, with the raiſed and raging Waves of the Sea, which almoſt continually pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into them; and monſtrous Iſlands of Ice, that ſeemed almoſt as big as <hi>Antecosta</hi> it ſelf, would ever now and then come athwart them. In ſuch a Sea they lived by the ſpecial aſſiſtance of God, until by the thirteenth of <hi>April,</hi> they got into an Iſland of <hi>Land,</hi> where they made a Fire, and killed ſome Fowl, and ſome <hi>Seal,</hi> and found ſome <hi>Gooſe-Eggs,</hi> and ſupplied themſelves with what Billets of Wood were neceſſary and carriageable for them; and there they ſtayed until the ſeventeenth. Here, their Boat lying near a Rock, a great Sea hove it upon the Rock, ſo that it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very point of <hi>overſetting,</hi> which if it had, ſhe had bin utterly diſabled for any further ſervice, and they muſt have called that Harbour by the Name, which, I think, one a little more <hi>Northward</hi> bears, <hi>The</hi> Cape <hi>without Hope.</hi> There they muſt have ended their weary days! But here, the good Hand of God again interpoſed for them; they got her off, and though they loſt their <hi>Compaſs</hi> in this Hurry, they ſufficiently Repaired another defective one, that they had aboard. Sailing from thence, by the Twenty Fourth of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:50205:33"/>they made Cape <hi>Brittoon;</hi> when a thick Fog threw them into a new Perplexity, until they were ſafely gotten into the Bay <hi>of Iſlands,</hi> where they again Wooded and Watred, and killed a few Fowl, and catched ſome Fiſh, and began to reckon themſelves as good as <hi>half way home.</hi> They reached <hi>Cape Sables</hi> by the Third of <hi>May,</hi> but by the fifth, all their Proviſion was again ſpent, and they were out of ſight of Land; nor had they any proſpect of catching any thing that lives in the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:</hi> which, while they were lamenting one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſtout <hi>Halibut</hi> comes up to the top of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by their ſide; whereupon they threw out the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Line, and the Fiſh took the Hook, but he proved ſo heavy, that it required the help of ſeveral Hands, to hale him in, and a <hi>thankful Supper</hi> they made on't. By the ſeventh of <hi>May,</hi> ſeeing no Land, but having once more ſpent all their Proviſion, they were grown almoſt wholly hopeleſs of Deliverance, but then a Fiſhing Shallop of Cape <hi>Ann,</hi> came up with them, fifteen Leagues to the Eaſtward of that Cape. And yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they got in, they had ſo Tempeſtuous a Night, that they much feared periſhing upon the Rocks, after all: But God carried them into <hi>Boston</hi> Harbour the Ninth of <hi>May,</hi> unto the great ſurpriſe of their Friends, that were in Mourning for them: And there furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with a Veſſel fit for their Undertaking, they took a Courſe in a few Weeks more to fetch home their Brethren, that they left behind them at <hi>Antecoſta.</hi>

               <p>Two Days after this, the King, upon what was propoſed by certain Lords, was very inquiſitive, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He might without breach of Law, ſet a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour over <hi>New-England;</hi> whereto the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and ſome others of the Council, anſwered, That whatever might be the Merit of the Cauſe, inaſmuch as the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſtood vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Judgment againſt them, it was in the King's Power to put them under what <hi>Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> He ſhould think beſt for them.</p>
               <p>The King then ſaid, <q rend="margQuotes">That He believed it would be for the Advantage of the People, in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, to be under a Governour appointed by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Nevertheleſs (becauſe of what Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> had ſpoken to Him) He would have the Agents of <hi>New-England</hi> nominate a Perſon, that ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto the Inclinations of the People there; and notwithſtanding this, He would have Charter-Priviledges reſtored and confirmed unto them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Day following, the King began another Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Holland;</hi> and when the Attorney General's Draught of a Charter, according to what he took to be his Majeſty's Mind, as expreſſed in Council, was preſented at the <hi>Council-Board,</hi> on the eighth of <hi>June,</hi> ſome Objections then made, procured an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prepare <hi>Minutes</hi> for another Draught, which deprived the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Eſſential Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> in their other Charter. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> put in his Objections, and vehemently proteſted, that he would ſooner part with his <hi>Life,</hi> than conſent unto thoſe <hi>Minutes,</hi> or any thing elſe, that ſhould infringe any Liberty or Priviledge of Right belonging unto his Country; but he was anſwered, That the Agents of <hi>New-England</hi> were not <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Soveraign State, and that, if they would not ſubmit unto the King's Pleaſure in the ſettlement of the Country, they muſt <hi>take what would follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50205:36"/>
               <p>The diſſatisfactory <hi>Minutes</hi> were, by Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s Induſtry, ſent over unto the King in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and the Miniſters of State then with the King were ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly applied unto, that every miſtake about the good Settlement of <hi>New-England</hi> might be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Queen Her ſelf, with Her own Royal Hand, wrote unto the King, that the Charter of <hi>New-England</hi> might either paſs as it was drawn by the Attorney General, or be deferred until His own Return.</p>
               <p>But after all, His Majeſties Principal Secretary of State received a Signification of the King's Pleaſure, That the Charter of <hi>New-England</hi> ſhould run in the Main Points of it, as it was now granted: Only there were ſeveral Important Articles, which Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> by his unwearied Sollicitations obtained afterwards to be inſerted.</p>
               <p>There were ſome now of the Opinion, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſubmitting to this New Settlement, they ſhould, in Hopes of getting a Reverſion of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Old Charter, declare to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, That they had rather have no Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all, than ſuch an one as was now propoſed unto Acceptance. But Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> adviſing with many unprejudiced Perſons, and Men of the greateſt Abilities in the Kingdom, <hi>Noblemen, Gentlemen, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> they all agreed, That it was not only a lawful, but all Circumſtances then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, a needful Thing, and a part of Duty and Wiſdom, to accept what was now offered, and that a peremptory Refuſal, would not only bring an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, but a Fatal, and perhaps a Final Ruine upon the Country; whereof Mankind would lay the blame upon the Agents.</p>
               <p>It was argued, That ſuch a Submiſſion was no Surrender of any thing; That the Judgment, not in the Court of Kings <hi>Bench,</hi> but in <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt the Old Charter, ſtanding on Record, the Pattent
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50205:36"/>was thereby Annihilated; That all attempts to have the Judgment againſt the Old Charter, taken off, would be altogether in vain, as Men and Things were then diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>It was further argued. That the Ancient Charter of <hi>New-England,</hi> was in the Opinion of the Lawyers, very Defective, as to ſeveral <hi>Powers,</hi> which yet were abſolutely neceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of the Plantation: It gave the Government there no more Power, than the Corporations have in <hi>England;</hi> Power in Capital Caſes was not therein particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed.</p>
               <p>It mentioned not, an <hi>Houſe of Deputies,</hi> or, an <hi>Aſſembly of Repreſentatives;</hi> the Governour and Company had thereby (they ſaid) no Power to impoſe Taxes on the Inhabitants, that were not Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or to erect Courts of Admiralty. Without ſuch Powers, the Colony could not ſubſiſt, and yet the beſt Friends that <hi>New-England</hi> had, of Perſons moſt learned in the Law, profeſſed, that ſuppoſe the Judgment againſt the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi>-Charter might be Reverſed, yet, if they ſhould again Exert ſuch Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they did before the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt their Charter, a new Writ of <hi>Scire Facias</hi> would undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly be iſſued out againſt them.</p>
               <p>It was yet further argued, That if an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould have Reverſed the Judgment againſt the <hi>Maſſachuſet-Charter,</hi> without a grant of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advantages, the whole Territory had been, on many Accounts, very miſerably Incommoded: The Province of <hi>Main,</hi> with <hi>Hampſhire</hi> would have been taken from them; and <hi>Plymouth</hi> would have been annexed unto <hi>New-York;</hi> ſo, that this Colony would have been ſqueezed into an <hi>Atom,</hi> and not only have been render'd <hi>Inſignificant</hi> in it's Trade, but by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it's Militia alſo, which was veſted in the King, taken away, it's <hi>Inſignificancies</hi> would have become, out of meaſure, humbling; whereas now, inſtead of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50205:37"/>ſeeing any Relief by Act of Parliament, they would have been put under a Governour, with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whereby ill Men, and the King's and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's Enemies, might probably have crept into Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to have done ten thouſand ill Things, and have treated the beſt Men in the Land, after a very uncomfortable Manner.</p>
               <p>It was laſtly, argued, That by the New Charter very great Priviledges were granted unto <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and, in ſome reſpects greater, than what they formerly enjoyed. The <hi>Colony</hi> is now made a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> and their General Court, has, with the King's Approbation, as much Power, in <hi>New-England,</hi> as the King and Parliament have in <hi>England.</hi> They have all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, and can be touched by no Law, by no Tax, but of their own making. All the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of their Holy Religion are for ever ſecured, and their Titles to their Lands, once, for want of ſome Forms of legal Conveyance, conteſted, are now confirmed unto them. If an ill Governour ſhould happen to be impoſed on them, what Hurt could he do to them? None, except they themſelves pleaſed; for he cannot make one Counſellour, or one Judge, or one Juſtice, or one Sheriff to ſerve his Turn: Diſadvantages enough, one would think, to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any ill Governour from deſiring to be Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in thoſe uneaſie Regions. The People have a Negative upon all the Executive Part of the Civil Government, as well as the Legiſlative, which is a vaſt Priviledge, enjoyed by no other Plantation in <hi>America,</hi> nor by <hi>Ireland,</hi> no, nor hitherto by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> it ſelf. Why ſhould all of this Good be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or deſpiſed, becauſe of ſomewhat not ſo Good attending it? The Deſpiſers of ſo much Good, will certainly deſerve a Cenſure, not unlike that of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabon,</hi> upon ſome who did not value what that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man counted highly valuable, <hi>Vix illis optari quid. quam pejus poteſt, quam ut fatuitate ſua fruantur:</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50205:37"/>Much good may do them with their Madneſs! All of this being well conſidered, Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> who had made ſo many Addreſſes for the Reſtoration of the Old Charter, under which he had ſeen his Country many Years flouriſhing, will be excuſed, by all the World from any thing of a Fault, in a moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected paſſage of his Life, which is now to be related.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Aſhurst,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> well knowing the agreeable Diſpoſition to do God, and the King, and his Country Service, which was in Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> whom they now had with them, all this while proſecuting his Deſign for <hi>Canada,</hi> they did unto the Council-Board, nominate <hi>Him,</hi> for the GOVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR of <hi>New-England.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> being by the Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi> introduced unto His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſaid,</p>

And I do moſt humbly thank your Majeſty, in that you have been pleaſed to give leave unto thoſe that are concerned for</hi> New-England, <hi>to nominate their</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Phips has been accordingly nominated by us, at the Council-Board.</hi> He <hi>hath done a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Crown, by enlarging your Dominions, and reducing of</hi> Nova Scotia <hi>to your Obedience.

               <p>The Effects of all this was, that Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> was now inveſted with a Commiſſion under the King's Broad-Seal to be <hi>Captain General,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in Chief,</hi> over the Province of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſet-Bay</hi> in <hi>New-England:</hi> Nor do I know a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, that could have been propoſed, more acceptable to the Body of the People through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>New-England,</hi> and on that ſcore, more likely, and able to ſerve the King's Intereſts among the People there, under the Changes, in ſome things unacceptable, now brought upon them.

               <p>WHEN <hi>Titus Flaminius</hi> had freed the poor <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> from the Bondage which had long oppreſſed them, and the Herald Proclaimed among them the Articles of their Freedom, they cryed out, <hi>A Saviour! a Saviour!</hi> with ſuch loud Acclamations, that the very <hi>Birds</hi> fell down from Heaven, aſtoniſh'd at the Cry.

               </p>

               <p>Governour <hi>Phips</hi> had, as every Raiſed and Uſeful Perſon muſt have, his <hi>envious Enemies;</hi> but the paleſt Envy of them, who turned their worſt Enmity upon him, could not hinder them from confeſſing, <hi>That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best of his Apprehenſion, he ever ſought the good of his Country:</hi> His Country quickly felt this on innumerable Occaſions; and they had it eminently demonſtrated, as well in his promoting and Approving the Councils Choice of good <hi>Judges, Juſtices</hi> and <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50205:39"/>which being once eſtabliſhed, no <hi>Succeſſour</hi> could remove them, as in his urging the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> to make themſelves happy by preparing a Body of Good Laws, as faſt as they could, which being paſſed by him in his Time, could not be nulled by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after him.</p>
               <p>He would often ſpeak to the Members of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, in ſuch Terms as theſe, <hi>Gentlemen, you may make your ſelves, as eaſie as you will for ever; conſider what may have any tendency to your welfare; and you may be ſure that whatever Bills you offer to me conſiſtent with the Honour and Intereſt of the Crown, I'll paſs them readily; I do but ſeek Opportunities to ſerve you; had it not been for the ſake of this thing, I had never accepted the Government of this Province; and when ever you have ſettled ſuch a Body of good Laws, that no Perſon coming after me, may make you uneaſie, I ſhall deſire not one Day longer to continue in the Government.</hi> Accordingly, he ever paſſed every Act for the welfare of the Province propoſed unto him; and inſtead of ever putting them upon Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Aſſent unto any good Act, he was much forwarder to give it, than they were to aſk it: Nor indeed, had the <hi>Hunger of a Salary,</hi> any ſuch Impreſſion upon him, as to make him decline doing all poſſible Service, for the Publick while he was not ſure of having any proportionable, or honourable acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>But yet he minded the Preſervation of the King's Rights, with as careful and faithful a Zeal, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a good Steward for the Crown: And, indeed, he ſtudied nothing more, than to obſerve ſuch a Temper in all things, as to extinguiſh what others have gone to diſtinguiſh; even the Pernicious Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſeparate Intereſt. There was a Time, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was infeſted with a vaſt number of Governours, who were infamous for Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Avarice and Villany; and referring to this Time,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50205:39"/>the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> had a Viſion of, <hi>People killed with the Beaſts of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> was none of thoſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; wonderfully contrary to this wretchedneſs, was the Happineſs of <hi>New-England,</hi> when they had Governour <hi>Phips,</hi> uſing the tenderneſs of a Father towards the People, and being of the Opinion, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare magis eſſe Regium quàm Diteſcere,</hi> that it was a braver Thing to enrich the People, than to grow rich himſelf. A <hi>Father,</hi> I ſaid; and what if I had ſaid, an <hi>Angel</hi> too. If I ſhould from <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> from <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and from <hi>Jerom,</hi> and others among the Ancients, as well as from <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Bucan,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> and <hi>Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and a thouſand more among the <hi>Moderns,</hi> bring Authorities for the Aſſertion, <hi>That each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Province, is under the ſpecial care of ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, by a ſingular Deputation of Heaven aſſigned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi> I could back them with a far greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than any of them all. The Scripture it ſelf does plainly aſſert it: And hence the moſt Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> writing of <hi>Common-Wealths,</hi> has a paſſage to this purpoſe, <hi>His ſingulis, ſuos Attributos, eſſe Angelos, ex Daniele, magno conſenſu, &amp; Judaei &amp; Chriſtiani ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres colligebant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>New-England</hi> had now, beſides the <hi>Guardian-Angel,</hi> who more inviſibly intended it's welfare, a <hi>Governour,</hi> that became wonderfully agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by his whole Imitation of ſuch a Guardian-Angel. He employed his whole Strength, to guard his People from all Diſaſters, which threatned them either by Sea, or Land; and it was remark'd, that nothing remarkably Diſaſtrous did befal that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from the Time of his Arrival to the Government, until there arrived an Order for his leaving it: (Except one Thing which was begun before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Government:) But inſtead thereof, the <hi>Indians</hi> were notably defeated, in the Aſſaults,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50205:40"/>which they now made upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Ships did alſo very advantageouſly fall into his Hands; yea, there was by his means a Peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto the Province, that had been divers Years languiſhing under the Hectic Feaver of a Lingring War.</p>
               <p>And there was this one thing more, that rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Government the more deſirable; That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis impoſſible for a meer Man to govern without ſome <hi>Error,</hi> when ever, this Governour was adviſed of any Error in any of his Adminiſtrations, he would immediately retract it, and revoke it, with all poſſible ingenuity; ſo that if any occaſion of juſt complaint aroſe, it was uſually his endeavour, that it ſhould not long be complain'd of

That there ſhould be ſtill choſen into the Council, One ſkilful in the <hi>Arts of Sorcerers,</hi> and able thereby to diſcover who might be guilty of thoſe <hi>Black Arts</hi> among ſuch as were accuſed before them.</p>
               <p>Now the Arrival of Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-England,</hi> was at a Time, when a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would have had Occaſion for all the Skill in <hi>Sorcerie,</hi> that was ever neceſſary to a <hi>Jewiſh Councellor;</hi> A Time when Scores of poor people had newly fallen under, a prodigious <hi>Poſſeſſion of Devils,</hi> which it was then generally thought had been by <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50205:41"/>It is to be confeſſed and Bewailed, That many Inhabitants of <hi>New-England,</hi> and Young people eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had been Led away with Little <hi>Sorceries,</hi> wherein they <hi>did Secretly thoſe Things that were not Right againſt the Lord their God;</hi> They would often cure Hurts with <hi>Spells,</hi> and practiſe deteſtable Conjurations with <hi>Sieves,</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> and <hi>Peaſe,</hi> and <hi>Nails</hi> and <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoes,</hi> and other Implements, to Learn the Things, for which they had a forbidden and impious Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Wretched Books had ſtoln into the Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Fools were inſtructed, how to become able For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-Tellers: Among which, I wonder that a blacker Brand is not ſet upon that Fortune-telling Wheel, which that Sham-Scribler, that goes under the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>R. B.</hi> has propoſed in his <hi>Delights for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,</hi> as an <hi>honeſt and pleaſant Recreation:</hi> And by theſe Books, the minds of many had been ſo poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they ſtudied this <hi>Finer Witchcraft;</hi> until, 'tis well, if ſome of them were not betray'd, into what is groſſer, and more ſenſible and Capital. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe <hi>Diabolical Divinations</hi> are more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily committed perhaps all over the <hi>whole World,</hi> than they are in the Country of <hi>New-England,</hi> yet, That being a Country Devoted unto the Worſhip and Service of the Lord <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> above the <hi>Reſt of the World. He</hi> ſignalized his Vengeance againſt theſe wickedneſſes, with ſuch extraordinary Diſpenſations, as have not been often ſeen in others Places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Devils,</hi> which had been ſo play'd withal, and, it may be, by ſome few Criminals more Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely engaged and imployed, now broke in upon the Country, after as aftoniſhing a manner, as was ever heard of. Some ſcores of People, firſt about <hi>Salem,</hi> the Centre and firſt Born, of all the Towns in the Colony, and afterwards in ſeveral other Places, were arreſted with many <hi>Praternatural Vexations</hi> upon their Bodies, and a variety of cruel Torments, which were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50205:41"/>evidently inflicted from the <hi>Daemons</hi> of the <hi>Inviſible World.</hi> The People that were <hi>infected</hi> and <hi>infeſted</hi> with ſuch <hi>Daemons,</hi> in a few Days Time, arrived unto ſuch a <hi>Reſining Alteration</hi> upon their Eyes, that they could ſee their Tormentors; they ſaw a <hi>Devil</hi> of a little <hi>Stature,</hi> and of a Tawny <hi>Colour,</hi> attended ſtill with <hi>Spectres,</hi> that appeared in more Humane Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Tormentors,</hi> tendred unto the Afflicted, a <hi>Book,</hi> requiring them to <hi>Sign</hi> it, or to <hi>Touch</hi> it, at leaſt, in token of their conſenting to be Liſted in the Service of the <hi>Devil;</hi> which, they refuſing to do, the <hi>Spectres</hi> under the command of that <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> as they called him, would apply themſelves to Torture them, with prodigious Moleſtations.</p>
               <p>The afflicted Wretches were horribly <hi>Diſtorted</hi> and <hi>Convulſed;</hi> they were <hi>Pinched</hi> Black and Blew; <hi>Pins</hi> would be run every where in their Fleſh; they would be <hi>ſcalded</hi> until they had <hi>Bliſters</hi> raiſed on them; and a thouſand other things before Hundreds of Witneſſes were done unto them, evidently <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural:</hi> For, if it were <hi>Praeternatural,</hi> to keep a rigid <hi>Faſt,</hi> for <hi>Nine,</hi> yea, for <hi>Fifteen</hi> Days together; or, if it were <hi>Praeternatural,</hi> to have ones Hands <hi>ty'd</hi> cloſe together, with a <hi>Rope</hi> to be plainly ſeen, and then by <hi>unſeen Hands</hi> preſently pull'd up a great way from the Earth, before a croud of People: Such <hi>Praeternatural</hi> Things were endured by them.</p>
               <p>But of all the <hi>Praeternatural</hi> Things which befel theſe People, there were none more <hi>unaccountable</hi> than thoſe, wherein the praeſtigious <hi>Daemons</hi> would ever now and then cover the moſt <hi>Corporeal</hi> Things in the World, with a <hi>Faſcinating Miſt</hi> of <hi>Inviſibility.</hi> As now; A Perſon was cruelly aſſaulted by a <hi>Spectre,</hi> that, ſhe ſaid, run at her with a <hi>Spindle,</hi> though no Body elſe in the Room could ſee either the <hi>Spectre</hi> or the <hi>Spindle:</hi> At laſt in her Agonies, giving a ſnatch at the <hi>Spectre,</hi> ſhe pulled the <hi>Spindle</hi> away;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50205:42"/>and it was no ſooner got into her Hand, but the other Folks then preſent, beheld that it was indeed a real, proper, Iron <hi>Spindle;</hi> which when they lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up very ſafe, it was nevertheleſs by the <hi>Daemons</hi> taken away to do farther Miſchief.</p>
               <p>Again; A Perſon was haunted by a moſt abuſive <hi>Spectre,</hi> which came to her, ſhe ſaid, with a <hi>Sheet</hi> about her, though ſeen to none but her ſelf. After ſhe had undergone a deal of Teaze, from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of the <hi>Spectre,</hi> ſhe gave a violent <hi>ſnatch</hi> at the <hi>Sheet</hi> that was upon it; where-from ſhe tore a Corner, which in her Hand, immediately was beheld by all that were preſent; a palpable Corner of a <hi>Sheet:</hi> And her Father, which was now holding of her, <hi>catch'd,</hi> that he might <hi>keep,</hi> what his Daughter had ſo ſtrangely ſiezed; but the <hi>Spectre</hi> had like to have wrung his Hand off, by endeavouring to wreſt it from him: However he ſtill held it; and ſeveral times this odd Accident was renewed in the Family. There wanted not the <hi>Oaths</hi> of good credible Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Alſo, It is well known, that theſe wicked <hi>Spectres</hi> did proceed ſo far as to ſteal ſeveral Quantities of Money from divers People, part of which Individual Money, was dropt ſometimes out of the Air, before ſufficient <hi>Spectators,</hi> into the Hands of the Afflicted, while the <hi>Spectres</hi> were urging them to ſubſcribe their <hi>Covenant with Death.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Poiſons</hi> to the ſtanders-by, wholly <hi>Inviſible,</hi> were ſometimes forced upon the Afflicted; which when they have with much Reluctancy ſwallowed, they have <hi>ſwoln</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that the common Medicines for <hi>Poiſons</hi> have been found neceſſary to relieve them: Yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Spectres</hi> in the <hi>ſtruggles,</hi> have ſo dropt the <hi>Poiſons,</hi> that the Standers by have ſmelt them, and view'd them, and beheld the <hi>Pillows</hi> of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtained with them.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50205:42"/>
               <p>Yet more, the miſerable have complained bitterly of <hi>burning Rags</hi> run into their forceably diſtended <hi>Mouths,</hi> and though no Body could ſee any ſuch <hi>Clothes,</hi> or, indeed any <hi>Fires</hi> in the Chambers, yet preſently the <hi>ſcalds</hi> were ſeen plainly, by every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, on the Mouths of the Complainers, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Smell,</hi> but the <hi>Smoke</hi> of the Burning, ſenſibly fill'd the Chambers.</p>
               <p>Once more; the miſerable exclaimed extreamly of <hi>Branding Irons</hi> heating at the Fire, on the Hearth, to mark them; now though the ſtanders-by could ſee no <hi>Irons,</hi> yet they could ſee diſtinctly the Print of them in the Aſhes, and <hi>ſmell</hi> them too as they were carried by the <hi>not-ſeen Furies,</hi> unto the Poor Creatures for whom they were intended; and thoſe Poor Creatures were thereupon ſo <hi>ſtigmatized</hi> with them, that they will bear the <hi>Marks</hi> of them to their Dying Day. Nor are theſe the <hi>Tenth Part</hi> of the <hi>Prodigies</hi> that fell out among the Inhabitants of <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Flaſhy People may <hi>Burleſque</hi> theſe Things, but when Hundreds of the moſt ſober People in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they have as much <hi>Mother-Wit</hi> certainly, as the reſt of Mankind, know them to be <hi>True,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the abſurd and froward Spirit of <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm</hi> can Queſtion them. I have not yet mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much as one Thing that will not be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be required, by the <hi>Oaths</hi> of more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſons than any that can ridicule theſe odd <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the worſt part of this aſtoniſhing <hi>Tragedy</hi> is yet behind; wherein Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> at laſt, being dropt, as it were from the <hi>Machin of Heaven,</hi> was an Inſtrument of caſing the Diſtreſſes of the Land, now <hi>ſo darkned by the Wrath of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> There were very worthy Men upon the ſpot, where the <hi>aſſault from Hell</hi> was firſt made, who apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves call'd from the <hi>God of Heaven,</hi> to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50205:43"/>ſift the buſineſs unto the bottom of it; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the continual <hi>Impreſſions,</hi> which the out-cries and the havocks of the <hi>afflicted People</hi> that lived nigh unto them, cauſed on their Minds, gave no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Edge to this Apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>The Perſons were Men eminent for <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> and they went about their enquiry into the matter as <hi>driven</hi> unto it, by a <hi>Conſcience</hi> of Duty to God and the World. They did in the firſt Place, take it for granted, that there are <hi>Witches,</hi> or, wicked Children of Men, who upon <hi>Covenanting</hi> with, and <hi>Commiſſioning</hi> of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> are attended by their Miniſtry to accompliſh the Things deſired of them: To ſatisfie them in which Perſwaſion, they had not only the <hi>Aſſertions</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> Aſſertions, which the <hi>Witch-Advocates</hi> cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade without ſhifts, too fooliſh for any <hi>Prudent,</hi> or too profane for any <hi>Honeſt</hi> Man, to uſe; and they had not only the well-atteſted <hi>Relations</hi> of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Authors from <hi>Bodin</hi> to <hi>Bovet,</hi> and from <hi>Binſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld</hi> to <hi>Bromhal</hi> and <hi>Baxter,</hi> to deny all which, would be as reaſonable as to turn the Chronicles of all Nations into Romances, of <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> and the <hi>ſeven Champions;</hi> but they had alſo an <hi>Ocular Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in one, who a little before had been executed for <hi>Witcheraft,</hi> when <hi>Joſeph Dudley</hi> Eſquire was the Chief Judge. There was one whoſe <hi>Magical Images</hi> were found, and who <hi>confeſſing her Deeds,</hi> (when a Jury of Doctors returned her, <hi>Compos Mentis</hi>) actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhewed the whole Court, by what <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſed unto them, ſhe directed her <hi>Familiar Spirits,</hi> how and where to Cruciate the Objects of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; and the Experiments being made over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, before the whole Court, the <hi>Effect</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed exactly, in the Hurts done to People at a diſtance from her. The Exiſtence of ſuch <hi>Witches,</hi> was now taken for granted by thoſe good Men, wherein ſo far the generality of reaſonable Men have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50205:43"/>thought, <hi>they ran well;</hi> and they ſoon received the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions</hi> of ſome <hi>accuſed</hi> Perſons to confirm them in it; but then, they took one thing more for granted, wherein 'tis now as generally thought they <hi>went out of the Way.</hi> The Afflicted People vehemently accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral Perſons in ſeveral Places, that the <hi>Spectres</hi> which afflicted them, did exactly reſemble <hi>Them;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the importunity of the Accuſations did provoke the Magiſtrates to examine them. When many of the <hi>accuſed</hi> came upon their Examination, it was found, that the <hi>Daemons,</hi> then a thouſand ways abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the poor <hi>afflicted</hi> People, had with a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exactneſs <hi>repreſented</hi> them; yea it was found that many of the <hi>accuſed,</hi> but caſting their Eye on the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,</hi> the <hi>afflicted,</hi> though their Faces were never ſo much another way, would fall down and lye in a ſort of a ſwoon, wherein they would continue, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Hands were laid upon them, until the Hands of the <hi>accuſed</hi> came to touch them, and <hi>then</hi> they would revive immediately: And it was found, that variou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinds of <hi>natural Actions</hi> done by many of the <hi>accuſed</hi> in or to their own Bodies, as <hi>Leaning, Bending, Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Awry, or <hi>Squeezing</hi> their Hands or the like, were preſently attended with the like things <hi>praeternaturally</hi> done upon the Bodies of the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> though they were ſo far aſunder that the <hi>Afflicted</hi> could not at all obſerve the <hi>Accuſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was alſo found that the Fleſh of the Afflicted was often <hi>Bitten,</hi> at ſuch a rate, that not only the <hi>Print of Teeth</hi> would be left on their <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but the very <hi>Slaver</hi> of Spittle too: And there would appear juſt ſuch a <hi>ſet of Teeth,</hi> as was in the <hi>Accuſed,</hi> even ſuch as might be clearly diſtinguiſhed from other Peoples. And uſually the <hi>Afflicted</hi> went through a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deal of ſeeming Difficulties from the torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spectres,</hi> and muſt be long waited on, before they could get a Breathing Space from their <hi>Torments,</hi> to give in their Teſtimonies.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50205:44"/>
               <p>Now many good Men took up an Opinion, That the <hi>Providence</hi> of God would not permit an <hi>Innocent Perſon</hi> to come under ſuch a <hi>Spectral Repreſentation;</hi> and that a concurrence of ſo many Circumſtances, would prove an <hi>Accuſed</hi> Perſon to be in a <hi>Confederacy</hi> with the <hi>Daemons</hi> thus afflicting of the Neighbours; they judged, that except theſe Things might amount unto a <hi>Conviction,</hi> it would ſcarce be poſſible ever to <hi>Convict</hi> a <hi>Witch;</hi> and they had ſome <hi>Philoſophical Schemes</hi> of <hi>Witcheraft,</hi> and or the Method and Manner, wherein <hi>Magical Poiſons</hi> operate, which further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them in their Opinion.</p>
               <p>Sundry of the <hi>Accuſed</hi> Perſons were brought unto their <hi>Trial,</hi> while this Opinion was yet prevailing in the Minds of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Juries,</hi> and perhaps the moſt of the People in the County, then moſtly Suffering; and though againſt ſome of them that were Tried, there came in ſo much <hi>other Evidence</hi> of their Diabolical Compacts, that ſome of the moſt <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and yet <hi>vehement</hi> Oppoſers of the Notions then in Vogue, publickly declared, <hi>Had they themſelves been on the Bench, they could not have Acquitted them;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, divers were Condemned, againſt whom the <hi>chief Evidence</hi> was founded in the <hi>Spectral Exhibitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it happening, that ſome of the <hi>Accuſed</hi> coming to confeſs themſelves <hi>Guilty,</hi> their <hi>Shapes</hi> were no more ſeen by any of the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> though the Confeſſion had been kept never ſo Secret, but inſtead thereof the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed</hi> themſelves became in all Vexations juſt like the <hi>Afflicted;</hi> this yet more confirmed many in the Opinion, that had been taken up.</p>
               <p>And another thing that quickned them yet more to Act upon it, was, That the Afflicted were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained with <hi>Apparitions</hi> of <hi>Choſts</hi> at the ſame Time, that the <hi>Spectres</hi> of the ſuppoſed <hi>Witches</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them: Which <hi>Chriſts</hi> always caſt the Beholders into far more Conſternation than any of the <hi>Spectres;</hi> and when they exhibited themſelves, they cryed out
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50205:44"/>of being <hi>Murdered</hi> by the <hi>Witchcrafts,</hi> or other Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of the Perſons repreſented in the <hi>Spectres.</hi> Once or Twice, theſe Apparitions were ſeen by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the very ſame time that they ſhew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>afflicted,</hi> and ſeldom were they ſeen at all, but when ſomething unuſual, and ſuſpicious, had attended the Death of the Party thus appearing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Afflicted</hi> People, many times, had never heard any thing before of the Perſons appearing in <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> or of the Perſons <hi>Accuſed</hi> by the <hi>Apparitions;</hi> and yet the Accuſed upon Examination have confeſſed the Murders of thoſe very Perſons, though theſe <hi>Accuſed</hi> alſo knew nothing of the <hi>Apparitions,</hi> that had come in againſt them; and the <hi>Afflicted</hi> Perſons likewiſe without any private Agreement or Collution, when ſucceſſively brought into a Room, have all aſſerted the ſame <hi>Apparations</hi> to be there before them: Theſe <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> did ſeem to call for an Enquiry.</p>
               <p>On the other Part, there were many Perſons of great Judgment, Piety, and Experience, who from the beginning were very much diſſatisfied at theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; they feared, leſt the <hi>Devil</hi> would get ſo far into the <hi>Faith</hi> of the People, that for the ſake of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Truths,</hi> which they might find him telling of them, they would come, at length, to believe all his <hi>Lyes,</hi> whereupon what a Deſolation of <hi>Names,</hi> yea and of <hi>lives</hi> alſo, would enſue, a Man might without much <hi>Witcheraft</hi> be able to Prognoſticate; and they feared, left in ſuch an extraordinary Deſcent of <hi>Wicked Spirits</hi> from their <hi>High Places,</hi> upon us, there might ſuch <hi>Principles</hi> be taken up, as, when put into <hi>Practice,</hi> would unavoidably cauſe the <hi>Righteous to periſh wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Woman in the Town, and when that Woman approached unto her, though the Eyes of the Creature, were never ſo ſhut, ſhe yet manifeſted a violent Senſe of her approach: But, when the Gracious Woman thus Impeached, had prayed earneſtly with and for this Creature; then inſtead of crying out againſt her any more, ſhe owned, that ſhe had in all, been deluded by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> They now ſaw, that the more the <hi>Afflicted</hi> were Hearkned unto, the more the number of the <hi>Accuſed</hi> encreaſed; until, at laſt, many ſcores were <hi>cryed out</hi> upon, and among them, ſome, who by the <hi>

               <p>In fine, the Country was in a dreadful <hi>Ferment,</hi> and wiſe Men foreſaw a long Train of Diſmal, and Bloody Conſequences. Hereupon they firſt adviſed, that the <hi>Afflicted</hi> might be kept aſunder, in the cloſeſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy; and one particular Perſon, (whom I have cauſe to know) in purſuance of this Advice, offered himſelf ſingly to provide Accommodations for any <hi>ſix</hi> of them, that ſo the Succeſs of more than ordinary <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Faſting</hi> might with <hi>Patience,</hi> be <hi>experienced,</hi> before any other Courſes were taken.</p>

               <p>AS one of the firſt Actions <hi>done</hi> by Sir <hi>William,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came to the Age of <hi>Doing,</hi> was to ſave the Lives of many poor People from the Rage of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Indians</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts of the Country, ſo now he was come to the Government, his Mind was very vehemently ſet upon recovering of thoſe Parts, from the Miſeries, which a New and a Long War of the <hi>Indians</hi> had brought upon them. His <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Youth,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> had rendred him well known unto the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> there; he had Hunted, and Fiſhed many a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day, in his Childhood with them; and when thoſe rude Savages had got the Story by the End, that <hi>he had found a Ship full of Money, and was know become all-one-a-King!</hi> They were mightily aſtoniſhed at it: But when they farther underſtood that he was become the Governour of <hi>New-England,</hi> it added a further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Conſternation to their Aſtoniſhment. He likewiſe was better acquainted with the Scituation of thoſe Regions, than moſt other Men; and he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd what vaſt Advantages might ariſe, to no leſs, than the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, from the <hi>Lumber,</hi> and <hi>Fiſhery</hi> and <hi>Naval-ſtores,</hi> which thoſe Regions might ſoon ſupply the whole Nation withal, if once they were well ſettled with good Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Governour <hi>Phips,</hi> took the firſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to raiſe an Army, with which he Travelled in Perſon, unto the <hi>Eaſt-Country</hi> to find out and cut off the Barbarous Enemy, which had continued for near four Years together, making horrible Havock on the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50205:48"/>Plantations, that lay all along the Northern <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>New-England:</hi> And having purſued thoſe worſe than <hi>Scythian Wolves,</hi> till they could be no longer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, he did, with a very laudable <hi>Skill,</hi> and unuſual <hi>Speed,</hi> and with leſs <hi>Coſt</hi> unto the Crown, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ever ſuch a Thing was done in the World, erect a ſtrong <hi>Fort,</hi> at <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Fort,</hi> he contrived ſo much in the very Heart of the Country now poſſeſſed by the Enemy, as very much to hinder the ſeveral Nations of the Tawnies from <hi>Clanning</hi> together, for the common Diſturbance; and his Deſign was, that a ſufficient Garriſon being here poſted, they might from thence, upon Advice, iſſue forth to ſurprize that ferocient Enemy. At the ſame time he would fain have gone in Perſon up the Bay of <hi>Funda,</hi> with a convenient <hi>Force,</hi> to have ſpoiled a Neaſt of Rebellious <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who being Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzed at St. <hi>John</hi>'s, had a yearly Supply of Aminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from <hi>France,</hi> with which they ſtill ſupplied the <hi>Indians,</hi> unto the extream Detriment of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but his Friends for a long time, would not permit him to expoſe himſelf unto the Inconveniencies of that Expedition.</p>
               <p>However, he took ſuch Methods, that the <hi>Indian Kings of the</hi> Eaſt, within a little while, had their Stomachs brought down, to ſue and beg for a <hi>Peace;</hi> And making their Appearance at the New-Fort, in <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> Aug. 11. 1693. They did there Sign an Inſtrument, wherein, lamenting the Miſeries which their Adherence to the <hi>French Counſels,</hi> had brought them into, they did for themſelves and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all the <hi>Indians</hi> from the River of <hi>Merrimack,</hi> to the moſt Eaſterly Bounds of all the Province, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Hearty Subjection and Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and ſolemnly Covenant, Promiſe, and Agree, to and with Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> Captain General and Governour in Chief over the Province, and his Succeſſors in that Place, <hi>That</hi> they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50205:49"/>would for ever ceaſe all Acts of Hoſtility towards the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and hold a Conſtant Friendſhip with all the <hi>Engliſh. That</hi> they would ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abandon the <hi>French</hi> Intereſts, and not ſuccour or conceal any Enemy <hi>Indians,</hi> from <hi>Canada</hi> or elſewhere, that ſhould come to any of their Plantations within the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Territories: <hi>That</hi> all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captives, which they had among them, ſhould be returned with all poſſible ſpeed, and no Ranſom or Payment be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for any of them; <hi>That</hi> their Majeſties Subjects the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> now ſhould quietly enter upon, and for ever improve and enjoy all and ſingular their Rights of Lands, and former Poſſeſſions, within the Eaſtern Parts of the Province, without any claims from any <hi>Indians,</hi> or being ever diſturbed therein: <hi>That</hi> all Trade and Commerce, which hereafter might be allowed between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould be under a Regulation ſtated by an Act of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> or as limitted by the Governour of the Province, with the Conſent and Advice of his Council. And <hi>That,</hi> if any Controverſie hereafter happen between any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Indians,</hi> no Private Revenge was to be taken by the <hi>Indians,</hi> but proper Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made unto His Majeſties Government, for the due Remedy thereof: <hi>Submitting themſelves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to be Governed by His Majeſty's Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the Manifeſtation of their <hi>Sincerity</hi> in the <hi>Submiſſion</hi> thus made, the <hi>Hypocritical Wretches</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Hoſtages</hi> for their Fidelity; and then ſet their <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Seals,</hi> no leſs than thirteen <hi>Sagamores</hi> of them, (with <hi>Names</hi> of more than a <hi>Perſian</hi> length) unto this Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>The firſt Riſe of this <hi>Indian War,</hi> had hitherto been almoſt as Dark as that of the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> 'Tis true, if any <hi>Wild Engliſh</hi> did raſhly begin to provoke and affront the <hi>Indians,</hi> yet the <hi>Indians</hi> had a fairer way to obtain Juſtice, than by Bloodſhed: However, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>New-Engliſh Revolution,</hi> the State of the <hi>War</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50205:49"/>became wholly <hi>New:</hi> The Government then employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all poſſible ways to procure a good Underſtanding with the <hi>Indians,</hi> but all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Offers, Kindneſſes, Courteſies were barbarouſly requited by them, with New Acts of the moſt perfidious Hoſtility. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, there were ſtill ſome <hi>Nice People,</hi> that had their ſcruples about the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>War;</hi> but upon this New Submiſſion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> if ever thoſe <hi>Rattle-ſnakes</hi> (the only <hi>Rattle-ſnakes,</hi> which, they ſay, were ever ſeen to the Northward of <hi>Merimack-River</hi>) ſhould ſtir again, the moſt ſcrupulous Perſons in the World muſt own, <hi>That it muſt be the moſt unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of Juſtice in the World for to extinguiſh them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did the God of Heaven bleſs the unwearied Applications of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> for the reſtoring of <hi>Peace</hi> unto <hi>New-England,</hi> when the Country was quite <hi>out of Breath,</hi> in its Endeavours for its own Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the continual out-rages of an inacceſſible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and by the <hi>Poverty coming in, ſo like an armed Man</hi> from the unſucceſsfulneſs of their former <hi>Armies,</hi> that it could not imagine, how to take one ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it's Wars. The moſt Happy Reſpite of <hi>Peace</hi> beyond <hi>Merimack-River</hi> being thus procured, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour immediately ſet himſelf to uſe all poſſible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, that it might be <hi>Peace, like a River,</hi> nothing ſhort of <hi>Everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He therefore prevailed with Two or Three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to join with him, in ſending a Supply of <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for Life,</hi> unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> until the General Aſſembly could come together to ſettle the <hi>Indian-Trade</hi> for the Advantage of the Publick, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> might not by Neceſſity be driven again, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>French</hi> Propriety; although by this Action, as the Gentlemen themſelves were great <hi>Loſers</hi> in their Eſtates, thus <hi>He</hi> Himſelf declared unto the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the General Aſſembly, that he would upon Oath, give an Account unto them of all his own Gains, and count himſelf a Gainer, if in lieu of all, they would
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50205:50"/>give him <hi>one Beaver-Hat.</hi> The ſame Generoſity alſo cauſed him to take many a tedious Voyage, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied ſometimes with his <hi>Fidus Achates</hi> and very Dear Friend, Kinſman and Neighbour, Colonel <hi>John Philips,</hi> between <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>Pemmaquid;</hi> and this in the bitter Weeks of the <hi>New-Engliſh,</hi> which is almoſt a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Winter.</p>
               <p>He was a ſort of <hi>Confeſſor</hi> under ſuch Torments of <hi>Cold,</hi> as once made the <hi>Martyrdom</hi> of <hi>Muria,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commemorated in Orations of the Ancients; and the <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Ice</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls, <hi>The Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mountains,</hi> he chearfully endured, without any other <hi>Profit</hi> unto himſelf, but only the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of thereby eſtabliſhing and centinuing unto the People the Liberty to <hi>Sleep</hi> quietly in their <hi>warm Neſts</hi> at home, while he was thus concerned for them abroad. <hi>Non mihi ſed Populo,</hi> the Motto of the Emperour <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> was engraved on the Heart of Sir <hi>William:</hi> NOT FOR MY SELF, BUT FOR MY PEOPLE: Or that of <hi>Maximin, Quo major, hoc Laborioſior,</hi> the more Honourable, the more Laborious.</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Reſtleſneſs</hi> of his Travels to the <hi>Southern</hi> as well as the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts of the Country, when the Publick Safety call'd for his Preſence, would have made one to think on the Tranſlation which the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> on a very extraordinary occaſion, gave the Fourth Verſe in the Hundred and Twenty firſt <hi>Pſalm.

Nor did he only try to <hi>Cicurate</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> by other Prudent and Proper Treatments, but he alſo furniſhed himſelf with an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Preacher of the Goſpel, whom he carried unto the <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> with an Intention to teach them the Principles of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and unteach them the mixt <hi>Paganry</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> which hitherto <hi>Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd</hi> them. To <hi>unteach</hi> them, I ſay; for they had been <hi>Taught</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Prieſts <hi>this</hi> among other things, That the Mother of our Bleſſed Saviour was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50205:50"/>a <hi>French Lady,</hi> and that they were <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> by whom our Saviour was murdered; and that it was therefore a <hi>meritorious</hi> Thing to deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. The Name of the Preacher whom the Governour carried with him, was <hi>Nahauton,</hi> one of the Natives; and becauſe the paſſing of ſuch Expreſſions from the Mouth of a Poor <hi>Indian</hi> may upon ſome Accounts be worthy of <hi>Remembrance,</hi> let it be <hi>Remembred,</hi> that when the Governour propounded unto him ſuch a <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtern Indians,</hi> he replied, <hi>I know that I ſhall probably Endanger my Life by going to Preach the Goſpel among the Frenchified</hi> Indians, <hi>but I know that it will be a Service unto the Lord Jeſus Christ; and therefore I will venture to go.</hi>

               <p>READER, 'Tis Time for us to view a little more to the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Picture</hi> of the Perſon, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of whoſe <hi>Life,</hi> we have hitherto been looking upon. Know then, That for his <hi>Exteriour,</hi> he was One <hi>Tall,</hi> beyond the common ſet of Men, and <hi>Thick</hi> as well as <hi>Tall,</hi> and <hi>Strorg</hi> as well as <hi>Thick:</hi> He was, in all Reſpects, exceedingly <hi>Robust,</hi> and able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſuch Difficulties of <hi>Diet</hi> and of <hi>Travel,</hi> as would have kill'd moſt Men alive: Nor did the <hi>Fat,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he grew very much, in his later Years, take away the Vigour of his Motions.</p>
               <p>He was well-ſet, and he was therewithal, of a very <hi>Comely,</hi> though a very <hi>Manly</hi> Countenance: A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance where any true ſkill in <hi>Phyſiognomy,</hi> would have read the Characters of a <hi>Generous Mind.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſing to his <hi>Interiour,</hi> the very firſt Thing which there offered it ſelf unto Obſervation, was a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Generoſity.</hi>

               <p>And of this, beſides the innumerable Inſtances, which he gave in his uſual Hatred of <hi>Dirty,</hi> or <hi>Little</hi> Tricks, there was one Inſtance for which I muſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, <hi>I never ſaw Three Men in this World that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual'd him;</hi> this was, His wonderfully <hi>Forgiving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> In the vaſt Variety of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> through which

               </p>
               <p>Upon certain <hi>Affronts,</hi> he has made ſudden <hi>Returns,</hi> that have ſhewed <hi>Choler</hi> enough, and he has by <hi>Blow</hi> as well as by <hi>Word,</hi> chaſtiſed <hi>Incivilities:</hi> He was, indeed, ſufficiently impatient of being <hi>put upon,</hi> and when <hi>Baſe Men,</hi> ſurprizing him at ſome <hi>Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> (for elſe few Men durſt have done it) have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drawn upon him, he has, without the <hi>Wicked Madneſs</hi> of a <hi>Formal Duel,</hi> made them feel that he knew how to <hi>Correct Fools.</hi> Nevertheleſs, he ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined a <hi>Deliberate Revenge</hi> of a <hi>Wrong</hi> done unto him; though few Men upon <hi>Earth,</hi> have in their <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes,</hi> been furniſhed with ſuch frequent <hi>Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of <hi>Revenge,</hi> as <hi>Heaven</hi> brought into the Hands of this <hi>Gentleman.</hi>

And when he did indeed become the <hi>Governour of</hi> New-England, he ſhew'd that he ſtill continued a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of himſelf,</hi> in his Treating all that had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been in ill Terms with him, with as much <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> as if there had never happened the leaſt Exaſperations: Though any Governour, that Kens <hi>Hobbianiſm,</hi> can eaſily contrive Ways enough to wreak a <hi>Spite,</hi> where he owes it.</p>
               <p>It was with ſome <hi>Christian Remark,</hi> that he read the <hi>Pagan-story</hi> of the Renowned <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who being preferred unto the higheſt Office in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, did through a Zeal for his Country, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the greateſt Contempts that any Perſon of Quality could have received. <hi>Minutius</hi> the Maſter of the Horſe, and the next Perſon in Dignity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, did firſt privately Traduce him, as one that was <hi>no Souldier,</hi> and leſs <hi>Politician;</hi> and he afterwards did both by Speeches and Letters, prejudice not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Army,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Senate</hi> againſt him, ſo that <hi>Minutius</hi> was now by an unpreſidented Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion brought into an <hi>Equality</hi> with <hi>Fabius.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50205:52"/>
               <p>All this while the great <hi>Fabius</hi> did not throw up his Cares for the Common-Wealth, but with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous <hi>Equality of Mind,</hi> endured equally the Malice of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the Fury of the <hi>Commons;</hi> and when <hi>Minutius,</hi> a while after, was with all his Forces, upon the Point of periſhing by the victorious Arms of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> this very <hi>Fabius,</hi> not liſtening to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of <hi>Revenge,</hi> came in, and helped him, and ſaved him; and ſo by a rare Virtue, he made his worſt <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi> the Captives of his <hi>Generoſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the Ancients, upon ſuch an Hiſtory, cried out, <hi>If Heathens can do thus much for the Glory of their Name, what ſhall not Christians do for the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi> And Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> did ſo <hi>much more</hi> than <hi>thus much,</hi> that beſides his meriting the <hi>Glory</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Name,</hi> as <hi>PHIPPI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S MAXIM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> he therein had upon him the Symptoms of a Title to the <hi>Glory of Heaven,</hi> in the <hi>Seal</hi> of his own <hi>Pardon</hi> from God. Nor was this <hi>Generoſity</hi> in HIS EXCELLENCY, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>New-England,</hi> unaccompanied with many other <hi>Excellencies;</hi> whereof the <hi>Piety</hi> of his Carriage towards <hi>God,</hi> is worthy to be firſt mentioned.</p>
               <p>It is true, He was very Zealous for all Men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſuch a <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> as he judged a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Right</hi> of <hi>Mankind:</hi> And he was extreamly Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, at the <hi>over-boiling Zeal</hi> of ſome good Men, who formerly took that wrong Way of reclaiming <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> by <hi>Perſecution.</hi> For this <hi>Generoſity</hi> it may be, ſome would have compared him unto <hi>Gallio,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Achaia,</hi> whom our Preachers, perhaps with Miſtake enough, think to be condemned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for his not appearing to be a <hi>Judge,</hi> in Matters which indeed fell not under his Cognizance.</p>
               <p>And I ſhall be content that he be compared unto that Gentleman; for that <hi>Gallio</hi> was the Brother of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who gives this Character of him, <hi>That there was no Man, who did not love him too little, if he could Love him any more;</hi> and, <hi>That there was no Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

               </p>
               <p>But while the <hi>Generoſity</hi> of Sir <hi>William,</hi> cauſed him to deſire a <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> his <hi>Piety</hi> would not allow a <hi>Liberty of Prophaneneſs,</hi> either to himſelf or others. He did not affect any mighty <hi>ſhow</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and when he ſaw any that were <hi>evidently careful</hi> to make a <hi>ſhow,</hi> and eſpecially, if at the ſame Time they were notoriouſly Defective, in the Duties of <hi>Common Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or the Duties of the <hi>Relations,</hi> wherein God had <hi>ſtationed</hi> them, he had an extream Averſion for them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, he did ſhow a Conſcientious Deſire to obſerve the Laws of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his <hi>Converſation;</hi> and he conſcientiouſly attended upon the Exerciſes of <hi>Devotion</hi> in the Seaſons thereof, on <hi>Lectures,</hi> as well as on <hi>Lords-Days,</hi> and in the <hi>Daily-Sacrifice,</hi> the Morning and Evening Service of his own Family; yea, and at the <hi>Private Meetings</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout People kept every <hi>Formight</hi> in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, when he had <hi>great Works</hi> before him, he would Invite good Men to come and <hi>Faſt</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> with him at his Houſe for the Succeſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and when he had ſucceeded in what he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, he would prevail with them to come and keep a Day of Solemn <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> with him. His <hi>Love</hi> to Almighty <hi>God,</hi> was indeed, manifeſted by nothing more, than his <hi>Love</hi> to thoſe that had the <hi>Image</hi> of God, upon them; He Heartily, and with a Real <hi>Honour</hi> for them, <hi>Loved</hi> all <hi>Godly Men;</hi> and in ſo doing, he did not confine <hi>Godlineſs</hi> to this or that Party, but wherever he ſaw the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> in one of a <hi>Congregational,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi> Perſwaſion, he did, without any Difference, expreſs towards them a Reverent Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50205:54"/>
               <p>But he made no Men more welcome, than thoſe <hi>Good Men,</hi> whoſe <hi>Office</hi> 'tis to promote and preſerve <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in all other Men; even the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Goſpel: Eſpecially when they were ſuch as faithfully Diſcharged their Office: And from theſe at any Time, the leaſt Admonition or Intimation of any good Thing to be done by him, he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a moſt obliging Alacrity. His <hi>Religion</hi> in Truth, was one Principle that added <hi>Virtue</hi> unto that vaſt <hi>Courage,</hi> which was always in him to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <hi>Heroical.</hi> Thoſe Terrible Nations, which made their Deſcents from the <hi>Northern</hi> on the <hi>Southern</hi> Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> in thoſe Elder Ages, when ſo to <hi>ſwarm out</hi> was more frequent with them, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with a <hi>valiant Contempt of Life,</hi> by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, wherein their famous <hi>Odin</hi> inſtructed them. <hi>That their Death was but an Entrance into another Life, wherein they who Died in Warlike Actions, were bravely feasted with the God of War for ever:</hi> 'Tis inexpreſſible, How much the <hi>Courage</hi> of thoſe fierce Mortals was fortified by that Opinion.</p>
               <p>But when Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> was asked by ſome that obſerved his <hi>Valiant Contempt of Death,</hi> What it was that made him ſo little afraid of <hi>Dying,</hi> he gave a better grounded Account of it, than thoſe <hi>Pagans</hi> could; his Anſwer was, <hi>I do humbly believe, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhed his Precious Blood for me, by His Death procuring my Peace with God: and what ſhould I now be afraid of Dying for?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Leads me to mention the <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Modeſt</hi> Carriage in him, towards other <hi>Men,</hi> which accompanied this his <hi>Piety.</hi> There were certain <hi>Pomps</hi> belonging unto the ſeveral <hi>Places of Honour,</hi> through which he paſſed; <hi>Pomps,</hi> that are very taking to Men of <hi>little Souls:</hi> But although he roſe from ſo <hi>little,</hi> yet he diſcovered a marvellous <hi>Contempt</hi> of thoſe Aie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Things, and as far, as he handſomely could, he declined being ceremoniouſly, or any otherwiſe than
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50205:55"/>with a <hi>Dutch Modeſty</hi> waited upon. And it might more truly be ſaid of him, than it was of <hi>Ariſtides, He was never ſeen the Prouder for any Honour, that was done him from his Country-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, albeit I have read that complaint, made by a worthy Man, <hi>I have often obſerved, and this not without ſome Bluſhing, that even good People have had a kind of ſhame upon them, to acknowledge their low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and uſed all Arts to hide it.</hi> I could never <hi>obſerve</hi> the leaſt of that Fault in this worthy Man; but he would ſpeak of his own <hi>low beginning</hi> with as much Freedom and Frequency, as if he had been afraid of having it forgotten.</p>
               <p>It was counted an Humility in King <hi>Agathocles,</hi> the Son of a <hi>Potter,</hi> to be ſerved therefore in <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Veſſels,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath informed us: It was counted an Humility in Arch-Biſhop <hi>Willigis,</hi> the Son of a <hi>Wheel-wright,</hi> therefore to have <hi>Wheels</hi> hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Bed-Chamber, with this Inſcription, <hi>Recole undè Veneris,</hi> i. e. <hi>Remember thy Original.</hi> But ſuch was the <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Lowlineſs</hi> of this <hi>Riſing Man!</hi> Not only did he after his return to his Country in his Greatneſs, one Day, make a ſplendid Feaſt for the <hi>Ship Carpenters</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> among whom he was willing at his Table, to Commemorate, the Mercy of God unto him, who had once been a <hi>Ship Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter</hi> himſelf, but he would on all occaſions <hi>permit,</hi> yea, <hi>Study</hi> to have his <hi>Meanneſſes</hi> remembred.</p>
               <p>Hence upon frequent occaſions of Uneaſineſs in his Government, he would chuſe thus to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Gentlemen, were it not that I am to do Service for the Publick, I ſhould be much eaſier in returning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Broad Ax again!</hi> And hence, according to the <hi>Affable</hi> Courteſie, which he ordinarily uſed unto all ſorts of Perſons (quite contrary to the <hi>Aſperity,</hi> which the old Proverb, expects in the <hi>Raiſed</hi>) he would particularly, when Sailing in ſight of <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> with Armies under his Command, call the

               <p>In fine, our Sir <hi>William</hi> was a Perſon of ſo ſweet a Temper, that they who were moſt intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, would commonly pronounce him, <hi>The best Conditioned Gentleman in the World!</hi> And by the continual Diſcoveries and Expreſſions of ſuch a <hi>Temper;</hi> he ſo gained the Hearts of them who waited upon him in any of his Expeditions, that they would commonly profeſs themſelves willing ſtill, <hi>to have gone with him to the End of the World.</hi>

               <p>When Perſons do by Studies full of <hi>Curioſity,</hi> ſeek to inform themſelves of things, about which the God of Heaven hath forbidden our <hi>curious enquiries,</hi> there is a marvellous <hi>Impreſſion,</hi> which the <hi>Demons</hi> do often make on the Minds of thoſe their Votaries, about the <hi>Future</hi> or <hi>Secret</hi> Matters unlawfully enquired after, and at laſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50205:57"/>there is alſo an horrible <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> which thoſe <hi>Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic Daemons</hi> do take of them. The <hi>Snares</hi> of Hell, hereby laid for miſerable Mortals have been ſuch, that when I read the Laws, which <hi>Agellius</hi> affirms to have been made, even in <hi>Pagan Rome,</hi> againſt the <hi>Vaticinatores,</hi> I wonder that no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman, or Gentleman ſignalizes his regard unto <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by doing what even a <hi>Roman Tully</hi> would have done, in promoting <hi>An Act of Parliament,</hi> againſt that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh</hi> Practice of <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> whereof, if ſuch Men as <hi>Auſtin</hi> were now Living, they would Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, <hi>The Devil firſt found it, and they that profeſs it, are Enemies of Truth and of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean Time, I cannot but relate a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Experience of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> by the Relation whereof ſomething of an <hi>Antidote</hi> may be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Poiſon,</hi> which the Diabolical <hi>Figure-Flirgers,</hi> and <hi>Fortune-Tellers</hi> that ſwarm all the World over, may inſinuate into the Minds of Men. Long before Mr. <hi>Phips</hi> came to be Sir <hi>William,</hi> while he ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>London,</hi> there came into his Lodging an Old <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> living in the Neighbourhood, who making ſome <hi>Obſervation</hi> of him, though he had ſmall or no <hi>Converſation</hi> with him, did (howbeit by him wholly undeſired) one Day ſend him a Paper, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had, with Pretences of a Rule in <hi>Aſtrology</hi> for each Article, diſtinctly noted the moſt material Paſſages that were to befall this our <hi>Phips,</hi> in the remaining Part of his Life; it was particularly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and Inſerted, That he ſhould be engaged in a Deſign, wherein by Reaſon of Enemies at <hi>Court,</hi> he ſhould meet with much Delay; That neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the <hi>Thirty Seventh</hi> Year of his Life, he ſhould find a <hi>mighty Treaſure;</hi> That in the <hi>Forty Firſt</hi> Year of his Life, his <hi>King</hi> ſhould employ him, in as great a <hi>Truſt beyond Sea,</hi> as a Subject could eaſily have: That ſoon after this, he ſhould undergo an hard <hi>Storm</hi> from the Endeavours of his Adverſaries to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50205:58"/>
                  <hi>Reproach</hi> him, and <hi>Ruine</hi> him; That his Adverſaries though they ſhould go very <hi>near</hi> gaining the Point, ſhould yet <hi>miſs</hi> of doing ſo; That he ſhould hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a vaſtly <hi>Richer Matter</hi> than any that he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto met withal; That he ſhould continue <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years</hi> in his <hi>Publick Station,</hi> full of Action, and full of Hurry; And the reſt of his Days he ſhould ſpend in the Satisfaction of a <hi>Peaceable Retirement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Phips</hi> received this undeſired Paper with Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and with Contempt; and threw it by among cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain looſe Papers, in the Bottom of a Trunk, where his Lady ſome Years after accidentally Lit upon it. His Lady with Admiration, ſaw ſtep after ſtep, very much of it accompliſhed; but when ſhe heard from <hi>England,</hi> that Sir <hi>William</hi> was coming over with a Commiſſion to be Governour of <hi>New-England,</hi> in that very Year of his Life, which the Paper ſpecified, ſhe was afraid of letting it ly any longer in the Houſe, but caſt it into the <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Thing which I muſt invite my Reader to Remark is this; That albeit Almighty God may permit the <hi>Devils</hi> to <hi>predict,</hi> and perhaps to <hi>perform</hi> very many particular things to Men, that ſhall by ſuch a <hi>preſumptuous and unwarrantable Juggle,</hi> as <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> (ſo Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> well calls it!) or any other <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination,</hi> conſult them, yet the <hi>Devils</hi> which <hi>fore-tel</hi> many <hi>True</hi> Things, do commonly <hi>fore-tel</hi> ſome that are <hi>Falſe,</hi> and it may be propoſe by the Things that are <hi>True</hi> to betray Men into ſome fatal Miſbelief and Miſcarriage about thoſe that are <hi>Falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very ſingular therefore was the Wiſdom of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> that, as he ever Treated theſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> about him with a moſt <hi>Pious neglect,</hi> ſo, when he had ſeen all but the <hi>two Laſt</hi> of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punctually fulfilled, yea and ſeen the beginning of a Fulfilment unto the <hi>Laſt but one</hi> alſo, yet when I pleaſantly mentioned them unto him, on purpoſe to <hi>Try</hi> whether there were any occaſion for me humbly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50205:58"/>to give him the ſerious <hi>Advice,</hi> neceſſary in ſuch a Caſe, to Anticipate the <hi>Devices of Satan,</hi> he preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Advice, by ſaying to me. <hi>Sir, I do believe there might be a curſed Snare of Satan in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies: I Believe Satan might have leave to foretel many Things, all of which might come to paſs in the beginning, to lay me aſleep about ſuch things as are to follow, eſpecially about the main chance of all; I do not know, but I am to Dye this Year: For my Part, by the Help of the Grace of God; I ſhall endeavour to live as if I were this Year to Dye.</hi> And let the Reader now attend the Event!</p>

               <p>'TIS a Similitude which I have Learned from no leſs a Perſon, than the great <hi>Baſil.</hi> That <hi>as</hi> the <hi>Eye</hi> ſees not thoſe Objects which are applied cloſe unto it, and even ly upon it; but when the Objects are to ſome diſtance removed, it clearly diſcerns them: <hi>So,</hi> we have little ſenſe of the Good, which we have in our Enjoyments; until God by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval thereof, teach us better to prize what we once enjoyed. It is true, the Generality of ſober and thinking People among the <hi>New-Englanders,</hi> did as highly value the <hi>Government</hi> of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> whilſt he lived, as they do his <hi>Memory</hi> ſince his Death; nevertheleſs it muſt be confeſſed, that the Bleſſing which the Country had in his indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Zeal, to ſerve the Publick in all it's Intereſts, was not ſo valued as it ſhould have been.</p>
               <p>It was mention'd long ſince, as a notorious Fault in <hi>Old Egypt,</hi> That it was <hi>Loquax &amp; Ingenioſa in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliam Praefectorum Provincia; ſi quis fortè vitave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Culpam, Contumeliam non effugit:</hi> And <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has been at the beſt, always too faulty, in that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50205:59"/>very Character, <hi>A Province very Talkative, and Irge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious for the vilifying of it's Publick Servants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> who might in a <hi>Calm</hi> of the Common-Wealth have adminiſtred all things, with as General an Acceptance, as any that have gone before him, had the Diſadvantage of being ſet at <hi>Helm</hi> in a Time as full of <hi>Storm</hi> as ever that <hi>Province</hi> had ſeen; and the People having their Spirits put into a <hi>Tumult</hi> by the diſcompoſing and diſtempering Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Diſaſters, which had long been rendring the Time Calamitous, it was natural for them, as 'tis for all Men <hi>then,</hi> to be <hi>complaining;</hi> and you may be ſure, the <hi>Rulers</hi> muſt in ſuch Caſes, be always <hi>complained</hi> of, and the chief Complaints muſt be heaped upon thoſe that are <hi>Commanders in Chief.</hi> Nor has a certain Proverb in <hi>Aſia</hi> been improper in <hi>America, He deſerves no Man's good Word, of whom every Man ſhall ſpeak well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> was very hardly <hi>Handled</hi> (or <hi>Torgued</hi> at leaſt) in the Liberty which People took to make moſt unbecoming and Injurious Reflections upon his Conduct, and Clamour againſt him even for thoſe very Actions, which were not only <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to be done, but highly <hi>Beneficial</hi> unto themſelves; And though he would ordinarily ſmile at their <hi>Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> calling it, <hi>His Country Pay,</hi> yet he ſometimes reſented it with ſome uneaſineſs; he ſeem'd unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſometimes almoſt as bad as Rolled about in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>'s Barrel; and had occaſion to think on the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Proverb, <hi>To wait for one who does not come; to ly a Bed not able to ſleep; and to find it impoſſible to pleaſe thoſe whom we ſerve, are three Griefs enough to kill a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as <hi>Forward</hi> as the People were, under the <hi>Epedemical Vexations</hi> of the Age, yet there were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few that would not acknowledge unto the very Laſt, <hi>It will be hardly poſſible for us to ſee another Governour, that ſhall more entirely Love and ſerve the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50205:59"/>Country:</hi> Yea, had the Country had the Choice of their own <hi>Governour,</hi> 'tis judged their <hi>Votes,</hi> more than forty to one, would have ſtill fallen upon him to have been the Man: And the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> therefore on all occaſions renewed their Petitions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King for his Continuance.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, there was a little Party of Men, who thought they muſt not <hi>ſleep till they had cauſed him to fall:</hi> And they ſo vigorouſly proſecuted certain Articles before the Council-board at <hi>White-hal</hi> againſt him, that they imagined they had gained an <hi>Order</hi> of His Majeſty in Council, to ſuſpend him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from his Government, and appoint a <hi>Committee</hi> of Perſons nominated by his Enemies, to hear all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> againſt him; and ſo a Report of the whole to be made unto the King and Council.</p>
               <p>But His Majeſty was too well informed of Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Integrity, to permit ſuch a ſort of Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; and therefore He ſignified unto His moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Council, that nothing ſhould be done againſt Sir <hi>William,</hi> until he had Opportunity to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and thereupon He ſent His Royal Commands unto Sir <hi>William</hi> to come over. To give any retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accounts of the Principal Perſons, who thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaried him, would be a Thing ſo contrary to the Spirit of Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> himſelf, who, at his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>New-England,</hi> bravely declared, that he <hi>freely forgave them all,</hi> and if he had returned thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, would never have taken the leaſt revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that <hi>This</hi> alone would oblige me, if I had no other Obligations of Chriſtianity upon me, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it; and it may be for ſome of them, it would be <hi>to throw Water upon a drowned Mouſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor need I to preduce any more about the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> which theſe Men exhibited againſt him, than <hi>This;</hi> that it was by moſt Men believed, that if he would have connived at ſome <hi>Arbitrary Oppreſſions</hi> too much uſed by ſome kind of Officers, on the Kings
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50205:60"/>Subjects, <hi>Few</hi> perhaps, or <hi>None</hi> of thoſe Articles, had ever been formed; and that he apprehended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be provided with a full <hi>Defence</hi> againſt them all.</p>
               <p>Nor did His Excellency ſeem loath to have had his Caſe Tried under the Brazen Tree of <hi>Gariac,</hi> if there had been ſuch an one, as that mentioned by the Fabulous <hi>Murtadi,</hi> in his Prodigies of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a Tree which had Iron Branches with ſharp <hi>Hooks</hi> at the End of them, that when any falſe Accuſer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, as the Fable ſays, immediately flew at him, and ſtuck in him, until he had ceaſed Injuring his Adverſary.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in Obedience unto the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he took his leave of <hi>Boſton</hi> on the ſeventeenth of <hi>November,</hi> 1694. attended with all proper Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Reſpect and Honour from the <hi>Body</hi> of the People, which he had been the <hi>Head</hi> unto; and with <hi>Addreſſes</hi> unto their Majeſties, and the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State from the General Aſſembly, humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring, that they might not be deprived of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which they had in ſuch an <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arriving at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> he found in a few Days, that notwithſtanding all the Impotent Rage of his Adverſaries particularly vented and Printed in a <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Libel,</hi> as well as almoſt in as many other ways, as there are Mouths, at which <hi>Fyal</hi> ſometimes has vomited out its Inſernal Fires, he had all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Aſſurance</hi> of his returning in a very few Weeks again, the Governour of <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, there were eſpecially <hi>two Deſigns,</hi> full of Service to the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as well as his own particular Country of <hi>New-England,</hi> which he applied his <hi>Thoughts</hi> unto. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He had a new <hi>Scene</hi> of Action opened unto him, in an opportunity to ſupply the Crown with all <hi>Naval Stores</hi> at moſt <hi>eaſie Rates,</hi> from thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> Province, which through the Conqueſt that <hi>He</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50205:60"/>had made thereof, came to be Inſerted in the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſet</hi>-Charter. As no Man was more <hi>capable</hi> than <hi>He,</hi> to improve this opportunity unto a vaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſo his <hi>Inclination</hi> to it, was according to his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he longed with ſome Impatience, to ſee the King furniſhed from his <hi>own Dominions,</hi> with ſuch floating and ſtately Caſtles, thoſe <hi>Wooden-Walls</hi> of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> for much of which He has hitherto Traded with <hi>Forreign Kingdoms. Next,</hi> if I may ſay <hi>next</hi> unto this, he had an Eye upon <hi>Canada;</hi> all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for the reducing whereof had hitherto prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Abortive.</p>
               <p>It was but a few Months ago, that a conſiderable Fleet, under Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler,</hi> which had been ſent into the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to ſubdue <hi>Martineco,</hi> was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then to call at <hi>New-England,</hi> that being recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, they might make a further Deſcent upon <hi>Canada;</hi> but Heaven frowned upon that Expedition, eſpecially by a terrible Sickneſs, the moſt like the <hi>Plague</hi> of any thing that has been ever ſeen in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> whereof there Died, e're they could reach to <hi>Boſton,</hi> as I was told by Sir <hi>Francis</hi> himſelf, no leſs than <hi>Thirteen</hi> Hundred Sailers out of <hi>Twenty One,</hi> and no leſs than <hi>Eighteen</hi> Hundred Souldiers out of <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was now therefore his deſire to have ſatisfied the King, that his whole Intereſt in <hi>America</hi> lay at Stake, while <hi>Canada</hi> was in <hi>French</hi> Hands: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to have laid before ſeveral Noblemen, and Gentlemen, how beneficial an Undertaking it would have been for them to have purſued the <hi>Canadien</hi>-Buſineſs, for which the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> were now grown too Feeble; their Country being too far now, as <hi>Bede</hi> ſays <hi>England</hi> once was, <hi>Omni Milite &amp; floridae Juventutis Alacritate ſpoliata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe <hi>two</hi> Deſigns in the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of Sir <hi>William,</hi> there was a <hi>Third,</hi> which he had Hopes that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50205:61"/>the King would have given him leave to have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, after he had continued ſo long in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to have obtained the more <hi>General welfare</hi> which he deſigned in the former Inſtances. I do not mean the making of <hi>New-England</hi> the Seat of a <hi>Spaniſh Trade,</hi> though ſo vaſtly profitable a Thing was likely to have been brought about, by his being one of an Honourable Company engaged in ſuch a Project.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Spaniſh Wreck,</hi> where Sir <hi>William</hi> had made his firſt <hi>good Voyage,</hi> was not the <hi>only,</hi> nor the <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> Wreck, that he knew to be lying under the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He knew particularly that when the Ship, which had Governour <hi>Boadilla</hi> Aboard, was caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there was, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſays, an entire Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Gold</hi> of <hi>Three Thouſand, Three Hundred and ten Pound Weight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Albemarl</hi>'s Patent for all ſuch <hi>Wrecks</hi> now expiring, Sir <hi>William</hi> thought on the <hi>Motto,</hi> which is upon the Gold <hi>Medal,</hi> beſtowed by the late King, with his <hi>Knighthood</hi> upon him, <hi>Semper Tibi pendeat Hamus:</hi> And ſuppoſing himſelf to have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient Information of the right Way to ſuch a <hi>Wreck,</hi> it was his purpoſe upon his Diſmiſſion from his Government, once more to have gone unto his old <hi>Fiſhing-Trade,</hi> upon a mighty Shelf of Rocks and Bank of Sands, that ly where he had informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

Sir <hi>William</hi> found himſelf indiſpoſed with a Cold, which obliged him to keep his Chamber; but under this Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he received the Honour of a Viſit from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Nevertheleſs his Diſtemper proved a ſort of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feaver,</hi> whereof many, about this Time dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the City; and it ſuddenly put an End at once unto his <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Thoughts,</hi> on the Eighteenth of <hi>February;</hi> to the extream ſurprize of his Friends, who Honourably Interr'd him in the Church of St. <hi>Mary Woolnoth,</hi> and with him, how much of <hi>New-England</hi>'s Happineſs!</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH he has now <hi>no more a Portion for ever in any Thing that is done under the Sun,</hi> yet Jaſtice requires that <hi>his Memory be not forgotten.</hi> I have not all this while ſaid, <hi>He was Faultleſs,</hi> nor am I unwilling to uſe for him the Words which Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> had in his Funeral Sermon, for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Earl of <hi>Warwick, It muſt be confeſſed, leaſt I ſhould prove a Flaterer, He had his Infirmities, which I truſt Jeſus Chriſt hath covered with the Robe of his Righteouſneſs: My Prayer to God is that all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities may be Buried in the Grave of Oblivion, and that all his Virtues and Graces may ſupervive,</hi> although perhaps they were no <hi>Infirmities</hi> in that Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> counted ſo.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs I muſt alſo ſay, That if the Anguiſh of his Publick Fatigues threw Sir <hi>William</hi> into any <hi>Faults</hi> of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> they were but <hi>Faults</hi> of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> ſoon Recalled: And <hi>Spots</hi> being ſooneſt ſeen in <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> there was uſually the <hi>moſt</hi> made of them that could be, by thoſe that were leaſt <hi>Free</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:50205:62"/>
               <p>After all, I do not know that I have been, by any perſonal Obligations or Circumſtances, charmed into any <hi>Partiality</hi> for the <hi>Memory</hi> of this Worthy Man; but I do here from a real Satisfaction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience concerning him, declare to all the World, that I reckon him, to have been really a very <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Man;</hi> that few Men in the World riſing from ſo mean an <hi>Original,</hi> as he, would have acquitted themſelves with a thouſandth Part of his <hi>Capacity</hi> or <hi>Integrity;</hi> that he left unto the World a notable Example of a Diſpoſition to <hi>Do Good,</hi> and encountred and overcame almoſt invincible <hi>Temptations</hi> in doing it.</p>
               <p>And I do moſt ſolemnly Profeſs, that I have moſt conſcientiouſly endeavoured the utmoſt Sincerity and Veracity of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as well as an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> in the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which I have now given of him. I have not written of Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> as they ſay <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> did of <hi>Cyrus, Non ad Hiſtoriae Fidem, ſed ad Effigiem veri imperii;</hi> what <hi>ſhould</hi> have been, rather than what really <hi>was.</hi> If the <hi>Envy</hi> of his <hi>few Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> be not now <hi>Quiet;</hi> I muſt freely ſay it, That for many Weeks before he died, there was not one Man among his <hi>perſonal Enemies,</hi> whom <hi>he</hi> would not readily and chearfully have done all the kind Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a <hi>Friend</hi> unto: Wherefore though the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in <hi>England,</hi> that once publiſhed a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> againſt ſome of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, choſe to put the Name of <hi>Publicans</hi> upon them, they muſt in <hi>this</hi> be counted worſe than the <hi>Publicans</hi> of whom our Saviour ſays, <hi>They Love thoſe that Love them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I will ſay this further; That when certain Perſons had found the <hi>Skull</hi> of a <hi>Dead Man,</hi> as a <hi>Greek</hi> Writer of Epigrams has told us, they all fell a Weeping, but only one of the Company, who Laughed and Flouted, and through an unheard of Cruelty, threw <hi>Stones</hi> at it, which <hi>Stones</hi> wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebounded back upon the Face of him that threw
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50205:62"/>them, and miſerably wounded him: Thus, if any ſhall be ſo <hi>unchriſtian,</hi> yea, ſo <hi>Inhumane</hi> as libellouſly to throw Stones at ſo deſerved a Reputation, as this Gentleman has dyed withal, they ſhall ſee a <hi>Just Rebound</hi> of all their Calumnies.</p>
               <p>But the Name of Sir <hi>WILLIAM PHIPS</hi> will be heard Honourably mentioned in the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> of <hi>Immortal Fame,</hi> when the Names of many, that <hi>Antipathied</hi> him, will either be Buried in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Oblivion, without any <hi>Sacer Vates</hi> to preſerve them, or be remembred, but like that of <hi>Pilate</hi> in the Goſpel, or <hi>Judas</hi> in the Creed, with Eternal Infamy.</p>
               <p>The old <hi>Perſians</hi> indeed, according to the Report of <hi>Agathias,</hi> expoſed their <hi>Dead</hi> Friends to be Torn in pieces by <hi>Wild Beaſts,</hi> believing that if they lay long <hi>unworried,</hi> they had been <hi>unworthy</hi> Perſons; but, all attempts of ſurviving Malice, to demonſtrate in that way, the <hi>worth</hi> of this <hi>Dead</hi> Gentleman, give me leave to <hi>Rate off</hi> with Indignation.</p>
               <p>And I muſt with a like Freedom ſay, That great was the Fault of <hi>New-England,</hi> no more to value a Perſon, whoſe <hi>Opportunities</hi> to ſerve all their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, though very Eminent, yet were not ſo Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as his <hi>Inclinations.</hi> If this whole Continent carry in its very Name of <hi>AMERICA,</hi> an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable <hi>Ingratitude</hi> unto that Brave Man, who firſt led any numbers of <hi>Europeans</hi> thither, it muſt not be wondred at, if now and then, a particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in that Continent afford ſome Inſtances of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude:</hi> But I muſt believe, that the Ingratitude of many both to God and Man, for ſuch <hi>Benefits,</hi> as that Country of <hi>New-England</hi> enjoy'd from a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of their own, by whom they enjoyed <hi>great quietneſs, with very worthy Deeds done unto that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by His Providence,</hi> was that which haſtned the Removal of ſuch a <hi>Benefactor</hi> from them.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:50205:63"/>
               <p>However, as the <hi>Cyprians</hi> buried their Friends in <hi>Honey,</hi> to whom they gave <hi>Gall</hi> when they were Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n; thus whatever <hi>Gall</hi> might be given to this Gentleman while he lived, I hope none will be ſo baſe, as to put any thing but <hi>Honey</hi> into their Language of him now after his Deceaſe. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſince 'tis a frequent thing among Men, to wiſh for the Preſence of our <hi>Friends,</hi> when they are <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>gone,</hi> whom, while they were preſent with us, we undervalued; there is no way for us to fetch back our Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> and make him yet Living with us, but by ſetting up a <hi>Statue</hi> for him, as 'tis done in theſe Pages, that may out-laſt an ordinary <hi>Monument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the original Deſign of erecting <hi>Statues,</hi> and if in <hi>Venice,</hi> there were at once, no leſs than an Hundred and ſixty two Marble, and Twenty three Brazen <hi>Statues,</hi> erected by the Order, and at the Expence, of the Publick, in Honour of ſo many Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Souldiers, who had merited well of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, I am ſure <hi>New-England</hi> has had thoſe, whoſe Merits call for as good an acknowledgment, and, whatever they did <hi>before,</hi> it will be well, if <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> they find many as meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as he to be ſo acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Now I cannot my ſelf provide a better <hi>Statue</hi> for this Memorable Perſon, then the <hi>Words</hi> uttered on the occaſion of his Death in a very great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, by a Perſon of ſo diffus'd and Embalm'd a Reputation in the Church of God, that ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from <hi>him,</hi> were enough to Immortalize the Reputation of the Perſon upon whom he ſhould beſtow it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> employ'd ſtill the moſt Honourable and Conſiderable Perſons they had among them, to make a <hi>Funeral Oration,</hi> in Commendation of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that had loſt their Lives, in the Service of the Publick: And when Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> the Captain
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50205:63"/>General of <hi>New-England,</hi> who had often ventured his Life to ſerve the Publick, did expire, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Perſon, who was the Preſident of the only Univerſity then in the <hi>Engliſh America,</hi> Preached a Sermon on that Paſſage of the Sacred Writ, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>Merciful Men are taken away, none conſidering that the Righteous are taken away from the Evil to come;</hi> and in it gave Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teſtimony.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Province</hi> is Beheaded, and lyes a Bleeding.

                  <p>He was a known Friend unto the beſt Intereſts, and unto the <hi>Churches</hi> of God: Not <hi>aſhamed</hi> of owning them: No, how often have I heard him expreſſing his Deſires to be an Inſtrument of <hi>Good</hi> unto them! He was a zealous <hi>Lover</hi> of his <hi>Country,</hi> if any Man in the World were ſo: He expoſed <hi>himſelf</hi> to ſerve it; He ventured his <hi>Life</hi> to ſave it: In <hi>that,</hi> a true <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that <hi>ſought the welfare of his People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was one, who did not <hi>ſeek</hi> to have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment caſt upon him: No, but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to my Knowledge, he did ſeveral Times Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the King, that this People might always enjoy the <hi>great Priviledge of chooſing their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour;</hi> and I have heard him expreſs his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that it might be ſo, to ſeveral of the Chief Miniſters of State in the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is now Dead, and not capable of being <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:</hi> But this I muſt teſtifie concerning him, That though by the Providence of God, I have been with him, at Home and Abroad, near at Home, and afar off, by Land, and by Sea, <hi>I never ſaw him do any Evil Action, or heard him ſpeak any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a Chriſtian.</hi>
